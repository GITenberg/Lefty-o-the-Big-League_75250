<small>GETTING IN BAD</small></h2>

<p class="cap">“Say, fellows!” sang out Red Pollock, the
snappy little shortstop of the famous
Hornets. “Look who’s here!”
There was a general turning of heads and craning
of necks on the part of three or four players
waiting their chance to wield the willow in batting
practice.</p>

<p>“Another Yannigan,” groaned Cy Russell, star
pitcher of the organization. “The woods is full
of ’em.”</p>

<p>“He don’t look much to me, neither,” stated big
Buck Fargo critically. “Say, Jim, who is it, an’
where’d you root it out?”</p>

<p>Brennan, the short, stocky, belligerent-looking
manager of the Big League team, did not answer.
With his bushy eyebrows drawn down in a frown
over his deep-set eyes, he was staring at the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
fellow threading his way through the groups of
players scattered about the field at all kinds of
training work. The stranger wore a soiled and
faded gray uniform, upon the shirt of which was
sewn a letter K, and dangled a worn leather glove
by one finger. His cap, pushed back on a mane
of heavy, dark-brown hair, revealed a clean-cut,
pleasant face, dominated by a pair of keen brown
eyes, a firm chin, and sensitive mouth.</p>

<p>As he took in these details Brennan’s scowl
deepened and his bulldog chin protruded dangerously.
Catching sight of his face, Pollock
grinned and nudged the man nearest him. “Look
at the old man,” he whispered. “Something
doing.”</p>

<p>The stranger came on without a pause, and, a
moment or two later, stopped before the manager.
His lips were pressed tightly together, but otherwise
his face was perfectly composed. “I’ve
come to report, sir,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>The manager’s eyes narrowed. Several things
had been fretting him all morning, and his temper
was not even at its uncertain best. “Indeed!”
he sneered. “And who are you?”</p>

<p>“Locke—Lefty Locke.”</p>

<p>“Never heard the name before,” retorted Brennan
shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>For an instant the newcomer seemed taken
aback. A faint touch of color came into his
cheeks, and he looked at the manager as if wondering
whether he could possibly be in earnest.</p>

<p>“I—thought—Mr. Toler had written you,” he
stammered. “He—said he was going to.”</p>

<p>Brennan’s eyes flashed. “Well, he didn’t,” he
snapped. “Where’d you come from? What’s
your record?”</p>

<p>“I pitched last season with the Kingsbridge
team of the Northern League,” Locke said briefly.</p>

<p>“A twirler!” exclaimed the manager. “Well,
I’ll be—” He stopped abruptly, gulped once or
twice, and then asked, in an ominously quiet
voice: “What did you do season before last?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. It was my first year in professional
baseball.”</p>

<p>“What!” Brennan’s face turned purple, and
his last shreds of self-restraint vanished. “You
pitched one season, an’ got the gall to expect a
job with the Hornets! You expect me to believe
that Ed Toler, the best scout I’ve got, picked you
up without saying a word to me about it—when
we’re overrun with pitchers, at that. I don’t
want you. Training was begun ten days ago, an’
I got enough men. You can hike back to the
bush, where you come from. I wasn’t born yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
an’ you can’t put one over me like this.
Get that?”</p>

<p>As he listened to the tirade, the color flamed
into Locke’s face, and his grip on the leather glove
tightened. Then, from the group of players, who
had been interested spectators of the interview,
came a smothered laugh, which seemed to act like
a tonic. As he heard it, Locke’s eyes narrowed
and his face hardened.</p>

<p>“You don’t want me?” he repeated, in a steady
voice. “You’re willing to release me from the
contract I made with Toler?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” growled Brennan.</p>

<p>“Then I’m free to accept any other offer?”</p>

<p>Something in his tone made the manager prick
up his ears, all his professional instincts aroused.
It is one thing to fire a man who isn’t wanted, but
quite another to let him go when another club
is after him. “Offer!” he sneered, with deliberate
intent. “I s’pose the Tigers an’ the Blue
Stockings are fair tearing each other’s eyes out
as to which’ll have you.”</p>

<p>Lefty’s lips tightened at the man’s tone. “You
guessed right, in a way,” he retorted. “Twenty-four
hours after I pledged with Toler, I had an
offer from the Blue Stockings of a thousand
dollars more than your scout promised me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>The silence which followed this statement was
eloquent. Some one in the little group near by
whistled incredulously. Brennan’s eyes were
fixed intently on the cub pitcher’s face, as if he
were trying to make out whether this was the
truth or a magnificent bluff. Accustomed as he
was to judging men, he was forced to admit that
the youngster did not look like a liar.</p>

<p>“And how much was that?” he demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five hundred.” Already Lefty was
sorry for his impulsive outburst. In a flash he
realized that if he had kept his mouth shut he
would have been free in a moment to accept the
better offer.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Brennan thoughtfully. If
Doyle, of the Blue Stockings—the Hornets’ most
bitter rivals—wanted this kid as bad as that, there
must be something in him, and it would never do
to let him go. Much as he hated backing water,
the manager was too shrewd a man to allow personal
feelings to influence his professional judgment.
He scowled deeply, bit his lips, and then
snapped sourly:</p>

<p>“Well, seeing as you’re here, you might as well
make yourself useful. Trot out there and take
that fellow’s place; I can use him somewhere else.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Toss a few straight, easy ones over the plate.
Stir your stumps now,” he went on, turning
fiercely on the astonished group near by. “You
boys get busy. We’ve wasted too much time.
We’ll stop this general shillalah swinging, and
take the field in regular positions. Every one of
you run your hits out. You need the exercise.”</p>

<p>Without a word, Lefty turned, and made his
way toward the cub pitcher, who had been shuffling
around near the slab waiting for the altercation
to end. He had been extremely foolish not to
keep his face shut, but there was nothing to be
gained by repining over the past.</p>

<p>An instant later, as his eyes met those of the
man he was replacing, he started slightly, and a
look of dazed surprise flashed into his face. It
vanished swiftly, but as he reached the fellow his
lips were compressed, his eyes hard and cold.</p>

<p>“Hello, Elgin,” he said stiffly.</p>

<p>The other, his face black as a thunder cloud,
growled out an unintelligible monosyllable, thrust
the ball into Locke’s hand, and walked hurriedly
away, leaving the latter to stare after him with
an expression which told, as well as spoken words
could have done, how unpleasant and distasteful
the encounter was to him.</p>

<small>A CALL-DOWN FROM THE MANAGER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The meeting had so surprised and startled
Lefty that he stood there for a moment
or two, ball in hand, watching Elgin join
the manager and start with him toward another
part of the field. He was aroused abruptly by a
drawling, sarcastic voice from the plate:</p>

<p>“Don’t hurry yourself, bub; any time to-day
will do.”</p>

<p>It was burly Buck Fargo, the prize backstop,
who stood leaning indolently on his bat, watching
Locke with mocking eyes. Lefty recognized him
instantly from the many published pictures he
had seen, and, berating himself inwardly for having
given the fellow a chance to criticise, he
swiftly toed the pitcher’s plate and sent the ball
over.</p>

<p>Of course, it went wide. The cub catcher let
out a stream of sarcastic language as he stretched
himself in vain for it. A joyful snicker arose
from the waiting players, and Fargo grinned aggravatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“Try again, bub,” the latter invited pleasantly.
“Jest a mite nearer this time, say a couple
of feet. This here stick’s only regulation length,
and I ain’t built like a gorilla.”</p>

<p>Lefty bit his lips and made no response. A
small boy retrieved the ball, and the irate catcher
whipped it out with decidedly unnecessary force.
With gritted teeth, Locke caught it, determined
that there would be no more exhibitions like that.
He did not know what was the matter with him.
To be sure, he had done very little pitching for
a long time, but he should be able to find the plate
better than this.</p>

<p>The second effort was not much of an improvement,
and a howl of derision greeted it; for there
is nothing a crowd of old baseball men enjoy more
than having fun with a green cub.</p>

<p>The sound had a curious effect upon Lefty.
Before the echoes of that jeering chorus died away
he had regained his grip. He realized that they
were doing their best to rattle him and cause him
to make an exhibition of himself, and his jaw
squared resolutely.</p>

<p>“I’ll fool ’em!” he muttered. “I’ll show him
something.”</p>

<p>He caught the ball easily, his eyes fixed on
Fargo’s grinning face. The big catcher stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
negligently swinging his bat, and when he saw
the sphere coming apparently straight toward
him with speed, he dodged back precipitously,
only to behold it shoot gracefully in and cut a
corner of the plate.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” he exclaimed. “Accidents
will happen. You’ve really got a curve, have you?
Let’s have another one like that, if you can do
it.”</p>

<p>Lefty could and did, and the batter sent the
horsehide soaring over the fence. Obedient to
instructions, he tossed aside his bat, and began
trotting leisurely around the bases. Halfway
between first and second he paused for a moment.
“You’ll learn, bub,” he chuckled. “Some time
next fall mebbe we’ll make a pitcher out of you.”
Then he resumed his placid way about the diamond,
while a new ball was produced, and Locke
faced the second batter.</p>

<p>Lefty did not try any more curves, for he had
suddenly realized that this was batting practice,
not an exhibition of pitching. He continued to
find the plate with a fair degree of accuracy,
however, and one after another the three other
players smashed out the sphere with joyous enthusiasm,
forgetting in the delight of batting to
continue their baiting of the new pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Not so Buck Fargo. He enjoyed batting quite
as much, as his companions, but he also dearly
loved to get a cub’s goat.</p>

<p>“Where’s your curves, bub?” he taunted, as he
took up his bat for the second time. “Can’t you
give us something interesting, or was they accidents,
like I thought?”</p>

<p>Lefty smiled faintly. He did not intend to give
Fargo the satisfaction of seeing that his words
made any impression whatever. In spite of his
determination, however, as he flung his arm forward,
unconsciously he gave it a little twist which,
made the horsehide—seemingly wide at first—cut
a corner of the plate in an elusive curve. The
batter hit it glancingly, and popped up a little fly
which Locke smothered without moving more than
a step or two from his position.</p>

<p>“Not bad for the bush,” chuckled Fargo, quite
undisturbed. “Saved me the trouble of stretching
my legs, anyhow. Come ahead, Cy, and see
what you can do with the boy wonder from Squedunk.”
He shot a swift glance out of the corner
of his eye toward a distant part of the field, and
went on in exactly the same tone, with scarcely a
perceptible break: “He’s got a baby curve or
two that might be fair if he could control ’em.”</p>

<p>Lefty was possessed by an irresistible impulse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
to see what he could do with the mighty pitcher,
Cy Russell. He knew perfectly well that the discomfiture
of one of their number might get the
whole bunch down on him, but he was a very
human individual, with a spice of obstinacy in
his make-up. Moreover, he had failed to catch
that quick glance of Fargo’s across the field, and
so was quite unsuspecting.</p>

<p>As Russell faced him, Locke deliberately sent
over a drop which fooled the batter completely.
A slow floater was equally successful, and a swift,
straight one, cutting the center of the pan, completed
the discomfiture of the notoriously poorest
hitter in the organization.</p>

<p>Fargo jeered out something about luck and
“goose eggs,” and hustled the next man to the
plate. Lefty, throwing prudence and common
sense to the winds, resolved to give them what
they clamored for if it was in his power. He
fooled the batter into swinging at a clever bender,
and then, oblivious to the sudden cessation of
Fargo’s taunting voice, was just winding up to
pitch again when a hand suddenly gripped his
wrist, and a harsh voice sounded in his ear:</p>

<p>“What the deuce do you think you’re doing,
Locke?”</p>

<p>Brought to earth, Lefty swung around, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
stared for an instant, with mantling cheeks, at
Jim Brennan’s angry face.</p>

<p>“Gimme that ball!” rasped the manager.
Locke handed it over without a word. “I s’pose
you think you’re mighty smart showin’ off your
cute tricks,” the older man went on, in a cold,
biting tone; “but that’s where you fall down—hard.
This is batting practice, not a Fourth of
July celebration. When I want any fireworks I’ll
let you know. Get that? Well, see you remember
it. Another stage play like this will be your
finish. All around the park, boys, and then back
to dinner.”</p>

<p>He turned from Lefty with an abruptness which
made it impossible for the cub pitcher to say a
word in his own defense, and perhaps it was just
as well. To tell the truth, there was nothing to
be said. Locke realized perfectly that he was
totally in the wrong. A moment later, as he
caught a glimpse of Buck Fargo’s grinning face,
it flashed over him that the whole thing was a
put-up job to get him a call. The big catcher
could not have failed to see Brennan coming long
before the manager got within hearing distance,
yet he had kept up his taunts to the last minute in
order that Locke might be taken by surprise.</p>

<p>“Looks like my luck had deserted me,” Lefty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
thought, as he fell into the line of men trotting
briskly around the field just inside the high board
fence. “Haven’t been here an hour before I get
a call from the manager and run into Bert Elgin.”</p>

<p>At the thought of the latter’s presence in the
squad, he frowned deeply. The call-down was
swiftly forgotten, but this other annoyance was
likely to be much more lasting and trouble-breeding
in its results.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<small>THE RIOT AT THE THEATER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“A rah, rah boy, is he?” sneered a voice
from the group not far away. “I see
his finish.”</p>

<p>Lefty knew they were talking about him. He
had been aware of the fact for five minutes or so,
but this was the first remark which had reached
his ears in its entirety. Sitting in a corner of the
Hatchford House lobby, he turned his head slightly
and met the belligerent glance of a burly, dark-browed,
full-lipped fellow of twenty-six or seven,
who was lounging against a pillar a little way off.</p>

<p>For a moment their eyes clashed, and then
Hagin—Lefty had heard him so called, and recognized
the name as that of the left fielder on the
regulars—laughed disagreeably and said something
to the man next him, who glanced up, stared,
and turned away with just the same sort of laugh.</p>

<p>Lefty’s eyes dropped to the newspaper he held
before him. In the scant nine hours since his
appearance on the field that morning, the wide difference
between a bush-league team and an organization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
like the Hornets had been forced upon him
at every turn. In his joy and astonishment at the
unexpected offer from Brennan’s scout, to say
nothing of the better one which followed it so
closely, he had given little thought to what his reception
would be by the other players.</p>

<p>He was far too sensible, of course, to expect
anything like an open-armed welcome, but he had
not quite counted on the cold-shouldered indifference
which was meted out to him from every
quarter.</p>

<p>The other fellows were mostly friendly enough
among themselves. On the field, in the hotel dining
room, and now in the lobby, they gathered
in little groups, laughing, joking, chaffing each
other in a way which, in no small degree, emphasized
the newcomer’s loneliness and isolation.</p>

<p>Lefty had tried several times during the day to
scrape acquaintance with some fellow who looked
pleasant and friendly enough, for he was a chap
who enjoyed the companionship of his fellow men,
and exactly the sort of joshing give-and-take
which is inevitable when a crowd of like-minded
individuals get together. His mild little efforts
had been met with such brusque, chilling indifference,
however, that he speedily gave it up.</p>

<p>“I seem to have gotten in wrong from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
start,” he reflected, as he sat with his eyes fixed
on the paper, though he had read scarcely a
word. “Brennan’s sore as a crab because he had
to back water before his own men. I wish to
thunder he hadn’t! I’d be better off. Then there
was that fool exhibition of mine on the field. I
suppose they all think I’m swelled up about my
pitching, and was showing off. And now they’ve
found out I’m a college man. I wonder how
they got wise to that. I didn’t mean any one
should know, if I could help it; some professionals
seem to have such a deep dislike for a fellow who’s
been through college. I wonder if Elgin could
have dropped a hint.”</p>

<p>In reality Lefty had quite missed the most important
reason of all. Other things may have
influenced the men in some small degree, but
the simple fact of his belated arrival at the training
quarters accounted for more than anything
else.</p>

<p>Ten days had been ample for the cubs, or new
recruits, to become acquainted. They had formed
their little cliques, split up into their different
factions. They were sufficient unto themselves.
It was natural for them to treat a new arrival
with jealous coldness, for every additional
candidate only decreased the chances of the others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
to make good. As for the old men—the regulars
of this especial team—they had small use for a
youngster until he showed himself made of the
right stuff.</p>

<p>At length, tired of sitting alone, Lefty arose
and sallied forth to take a casual inspection of
the Texas town. Ashland was a place of some
size, and decidedly up to date. A number of
factories and various oil refineries gave employment
to several thousand workmen, the majority
of whom—it seemed to Lefty—were thronging the
brightly lighted streets, blocking the corners,
or crowding into the many moving-picture or
vaudeville shows which lined the main thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Lefty did not find this solitary inspection of the
town very exciting, and, after he had traversed a
few of the principal streets, he decided that he
had had enough. A glance at his watch told him
that it was only a quarter to eight. The evening
seemed to be dragging along with infinite slowness.
He might return to the hotel and go to bed,
of course, but he wasn’t in the least sleepy, and
somehow he had a feeling that by doing such a
thing he would be giving in. Finally the glaring
lights of a combination moving-picture and vaudeville
show across the street gave him an idea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Crossing hastily, he bought a ticket and pushed
into the darkened auditorium.</p>

<p>The place was jammed to the doors with a rather
boisterous crowd, made up almost entirely of men.
Lefty could see no vacant seat, and so he took his
place against the wall back of the last row, from
which position he watched the progress of the
pictured drama with a certain amount of interest.
There was no questioning the unusual excellence of
the films.</p>

<p>Two of them were rolled off before the stage
lights went up and the curtain lifted upon the
Montmorency Sisters, vocalists. Lefty yawned,
and decided to get out. The place was hot and
stuffy, and he was on the point of crowding past
the later arrivals who filled the space near him,
when, suddenly catching sight of two men sitting
three rows away, he changed his mind.</p>

<p>One of them was a total stranger. Lefty did
not remember ever having seen him before. The
other was Bert Elgin, and, as his eyes took in the
sharp profile, with the familiar, sneering uplift at
the corner of the lips, Locke’s face darkened. The
face had changed little since he had last seen it.
An added line or two showed about the mouth,
perhaps, and there was, no doubt, a certain maturity
which years alone can bring. In all essential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
features, however, it was unaltered, and
the sight of it brought a rush of vivid recollection
into Lefty’s mind which made him frown.
It seemed the irony of fate that they two should
meet again under conditions which must throw
them together in most undesirable terms of intimacy.</p>

<p>Oblivious to the twittering pair capering about
the stage, Lefty stood staring at the back of Elgin’s
head with unseeing eyes. His mind was back
in the past, and his expression showed how unpleasant
the remembrance was.</p>

<p>The burst of handclapping at the end of the act
aroused him in time to see Elgin and his companion
arise and crowd toward the aisle. He
stood there waiting for them to go, for he had
no desire to encounter the fellow just now. With
narrowing eyes, he watched his old enemy elbow
his way roughly toward the door, careless of who
or what was in his path.</p>

<p>It all came about so suddenly and unexpectedly
that Lefty never knew just what was the real
cause. He saw one or two men turn and stare
angrily at the fellow shoving his way past them,
muttering something under their breath as they
did so. Then, just as the pair were opposite him
and close to the door, Locke heard a sharp cry of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
pain in a woman’s voice, followed instantly by a
bellow of fury from a man. Swiftly there came
the thud of bare fists against flesh and bone. A
dozen men sprang up and began shoving toward
the door. A woman screamed shrilly.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<small>ONE AGAINST SCORES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Instinctively Lefty joined the rush
toward the center of disturbance. He caught
a glimpse of two men struggling in close
embrace, each raining blows upon the other’s face
and body. He saw that one of them was Bert
Elgin. The other was a big, burly fellow, dressed
in a workman’s Sunday best, his face flushed, his
eyes aflame with anger.</p>

<p>A score of other men were trying to get close
enough to put in a blow or two. The place resounded
with shouts of: “Kill him!” “Lynch
him!” “Beat him up!” Then the whole struggling
mob burst through the narrow doorway into
the garish, glittering lobby.</p>

<p>Lefty was borne irresistibly toward the door by
the crowd behind him, which seemed eager to take
part in the fracas. By the time he reached it the
entire audience was on its feet, making for the
single exit. Hands pinioned helplessly at his
sides, Locke was forced into the maelstrom of
bodies. There was a squeeze, a breathless grunt,
and he plunged out into the dazzling brightness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>The disturbance had ceased to be a fight and
turned into a riot. The mob was made up of men
in the raw, lacking in self-restraint, whose passions
were roused to a white heat with very little
cause. A woman’s cry of pain, the roar of fury
from her escort, and the trouble was started.</p>

<p>As they surged against the frail, ornate booth
from which tickets were dispensed, they were like
a lot of madmen. Not half a dozen out of the
crowd knew what the disturbance was about.
Blows were rained on the heads and shoulders and
backs of friends in their eagerness to get at the
man in the very heart of that seething throng, and
already two vigorous personal encounters had been
started in different corners of the lobby on that account.</p>

<p>As he was flung forward against the side of the
ticket booth, Lefty felt sudden anger surge up
within him. He forgot that Bert Elgin was his
enemy, and remembered only that he was battling
against odds. And when, a moment later, by some
odd trick of chance, he saw the fellow’s face,
bruised, battered, blood trickling from a cut on his
cheek, and caught a fleeting glance of desperate appeal
from Elgin’s terror-stricken eyes, he threw
caution to the winds and jumped into the fray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>The very size of the mob was in Locke’s favor,
but it is doubtful whether he could have done
much to help Elgin except for the unexpected giving
way of the ticket booth. Slowly it began to
sway under the tremendous pressure against one
side. A door at the back was burst suddenly open,
and the ticket agent dashed forth, clutching the
cash drawer in both hands, only to trip and fall
headlong, scattering money in every direction, and
causing a new diversion. The crashing over of
the booth was another, and for an instant Elgin
was freed from the clutching hands which had held
him prisoner.</p>

<p>Lefty darted forward, gripped the man by
the shoulders, and dragged him into the angle
made by the wrecked booth and one wall of the
lobby. Petrified by fear, the fellow sank helplessly
to the floor, and Locke had barely time to
leap in front of him before the yelling crowd
surged forward again.</p>

<p>In the second that he stood there waiting, the
cub pitcher was conscious of a curious feeling
which had come to him once or twice before at
moments of great tension on the diamond. It was
as if his brain had been wiped with a cold, wet
sponge, clarifying his vision, and soothing his raw
nerves to an almost uncanny degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>He felt that there could be but one end to
the encounter, and yet he was not afraid. He
eyed the semicircle of angry faces calmly, coolly,
appraisingly, mentally picking out the exact spot
on the protruding jaw of the foremost man with
which he meant to make connections an instant
later. When the fellow went down before his
beautiful swinging blow, Lefty felt a thrill of successful
accomplishment.</p>

<p>A second man swiftly followed the first, but
after that there was no time for picking and choosing.
With a howl of rage, the crowd rushed forward
in a body, bent on getting their hands on
their prey and crushing him bodily. Luckily only
three men could face Locke at once, and for a
brief space he held them back by sheer skill and
trained muscles.</p>

<p>With fine precision he wasted not a single effort,
but broke through clumsy guarding arms, to land
on some vital spot with a jolt which sent his man
reeling back against the others, or else crumpled
him to the floor.</p>

<p>In about three minutes those in the front rank
were seeking to escape the deadly accuracy of his
blows by dodging to one side or trying to push
back through the crowd. Unfortunately for
Locke, those in the rear continued to force their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
way forward, and thus slowly but inexorably the
ring closed in.</p>

<p>Lefty’s arms moved faster and faster. He had
long ago ceased to pick and choose—it was impossible.
Several times he had leaped back before it
occurred to him to wonder what had become of
Elgin. That was but a fleeting thought, however.
He had never counted on the fellow’s aid, so it
was just as well that he was not in the way.</p>

<p>A number of glancing blows had struck home,
one cutting his lips. At last he began to wonder
how long he could keep it up, and what the end
would be. He knew he might expect no mercy
from the maddened crowd, all of whom supposed,
by this time, that he was the one who had started
the fracas. Unless the police came soon, or some
other help—</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt a movement behind him. His
first thought was that his enemies had found a
way to get him at the rear; but even before he
could whirl about to face them, two hands caught
his shoulders, and a familiar voice sounded in his
ear:</p>

<p>“Lemme have a whack at ’em, kid.”</p>

<p>It was Buck Fargo, the big catcher of the
Hornets.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<small>FRIENDLY BUCK FARGO</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dazed, bewildered, a sudden overpowering
weakness gripping his limbs, Lefty felt
himself thrust against the wall, and saw
the massive form of the man who had baited him so
successfully on the field that morning leap into
the front place, eyes blazing and huge fists doubled
for action.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the sight of him—burly, menacing,
and fresh—which turned the tide. More
likely it was that sudden panicky awakening which
comes to every mob when the first outburst of
passion has run its course. At all events, Fargo
had no more than time to land his fist with precision
and force on the faces of two men, before
some one at the rear started a yell that the cops
were coming.</p>

<p>The effect was magical. Out into the street
poured the mob, and fled wildly in every direction.
Before he realized that it was all over Lefty felt
himself grasped by the shoulders, hustled out of
the barricade and rushed across the street. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
whole thoroughfare was filled with flying men,
so that they passed unnoticed as Fargo headed
straight for the nearest corner.</p>

<p>“Them cops is coming at last,” he explained
shortly, whirling into a side street. “We don’t
want to be pinched. Think you’re good for the
hotel, kid? If you ain’t, we can stop at a drug
store and have you patched up.”</p>

<p>“I can make it all right,” Lefty gasped. “I’m
only—dead beat.” An instant later he stopped
still. “What became of Elgin?” he asked abruptly.
“I forgot him.”</p>

<p>“He beat it.” Fargo’s tone was noncommittal.
“He crawled out the same way I got in, while they
was busy with you. That ticket coop was held
up a mite at the end by hitting against the wall.
He’s all safe.”</p>

<p>There was an expression of curiosity on the
catcher’s face, and for a moment he seemed about
to ask a question. Apparently he changed his
mind, however, for the next instant his lips closed
and he hustled Lefty on again.</p>

<p>They reached the hotel without attracting much
attention. Locke had managed to wipe most of
the stains of battle from his face, and as they
entered the side door Fargo clapped his own wide-brimmed
felt hat on the other’s head, starting some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
rough bantering with the elevator boy, which kept
the fellow occupied. They stepped out on the top
floor without the boy having really noticed Lefty
at all.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll take stock, kid,” the catcher said,
as he switched on the lights in Lefty’s room and
closed the door. “That face of yours ain’t so
bad, after all. We’ll fix your mouth up in a jiffy.
Got any plaster?”</p>

<p>Locke nodded. “Yes, but I don’t want you to
bother about it, Fargo. It’s white of you to—”</p>

<p>“Stow that, son!” interrupted the big chap
shortly. “This rumpus is going to get the old
man up on his ear for fair. If he finds out you
was in it, there’ll be blazes to pay.”</p>

<p>“But how can he help it? I was there, and
everybody saw me.”</p>

<p>“Sure you was,” grinned Fargo, dexterously
applying a wet towel to Locke’s countenance.
“In the scuffle you got a tap or two by mistake;
that’s all. You don’t s’pose that crazy bunch of
roughnecks is going to remember faces, do you?
They was clean off their nuts, every last one of
’em.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment or two as the
big, muscular fingers applied the plaster to the
cut lips with surprising deftness. “There!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Fargo said with satisfaction. “That’ll do fine.
There’s a scratch alongside your nose, but it don’t
amount to nothing. Pull off your shirt, and let’s
have a look at the rest of you.”</p>

<p>Lefty obeyed without question, and revealed a
muscular chest dotted here and there with bruises
already beginning to darken. It had been impossible
to guard himself at every point from the
frenzied rushes, and he had instinctively protected
his face.</p>

<p>Fargo grinned as he saw the damage. “Won’t
you be stiff and sore to-morrow morning!” he
chuckled. “It’s lucky you can lay it to the first
day’s practice. Say, kid, how in thunder did you
two start that riot? You look like a peaceable guy
to me.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t start it,” Lefty returned swiftly. “I
broke into the game afterward.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Let’s hear about it.”</p>

<p>Briefly, Lefty told him what little he knew about
the beginning of the trouble. He said nothing of
his dislike for Bert Elgin, but Fargo must have
guessed it from his manner.</p>

<p>“So that’s it?” the catcher commented. “I
gather you two ain’t very chummy.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” Lefty returned shortly.</p>

<p>Fargo eyed him curiously. “Then why did you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
butt in? He started the muss, and I should say he
deserved what he got.”</p>

<p>“But the whole push was against him,” protested
Locke. “I couldn’t sneak off and let them
hammer him to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Strikes me that <em>he</em> sneaked,” Fargo said
swiftly. “When I came across the street to see
what was doing, there wasn’t any use trying to
get near the front, so I made for the corner to
see if I could get a glimpse over the top of that
tipped-over ticket cage. I hadn’t been there a
minute before Elgin came crawling out from underneath.
He was so blamed scared that I hadn’t
more’n got out of him that you were in there alone
when he beat it. Looks like it didn’t worry him
any to leave you alone for the bunch to hammer.”</p>

<p>Lefty smiled faintly. “Can’t help that. It
was up to him. I’d have hated myself if I’d gone
away and left any man in that kind of a hole.”
He hesitated an instant, the color rising to his
face. “Besides, even if we aren’t friends, he’s—one
of the bunch.”</p>

<p>Fargo stared at him oddly; then he broke into
a laugh. “Time we was both in bed,” he said
abruptly. “Don’t forget to keep your trap shut
about this to-morrow. You was there and got a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
love tap or two in the scuffle. Lucky the old man
can’t see that chest of yours.”</p>

<p>Outside the door he paused, the queer look in
his eyes again. “One of the bunch!” he muttered
aloud. “Well, I’ll be hanged!”</p>

<small>WHO WAS TO BLAME?</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On his way in to breakfast next morning,
Manager Brennan bought a copy of the
Ashland <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite> to glance
through during the progress of the meal. Having
seated himself and given his order, he
spread open the sheet. The first thing to catch
his eye was the flaming headline, “Palace Theater
Wrecked by Mob.”</p>

<p>Having heard echoes of the affair the night
before, the manager glanced over the account with
interest. Halfway down the column he stopped
short, clutched the paper, and stared with bulging
eyes and purpling cheeks at a certain short paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The cause of the riot is not definitely known. It is said,
however, to have been started by the rowdyish behavior of one
of the visiting baseball men who was attending the performance.
We might call Manager Brennan’s attention to the
fact that, while Ashland is always ready to extend every hospitality
to himself and his famous organization, she does not
care about having that hospitality abused.</p>
</div>

<p>With a guttural exclamation of rage, Brennan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
half started from his seat, only to relax again
and glare around.</p>

<p>“You read that stuff?” he demanded, catching
the eye of Red Pollock across the table.</p>

<p>“Sure!” grinned the latter. “Great dope. If
Cy hadn’t coaxed me into a game of draw, I’d
been there myself, instead of missing all the fun.”</p>

<p>“You’d ought to thank me,” said Russell philosophically.
“If you hadn’t been so busy losing
your dough to Pete and me, you’d likely got your
block knocked off down the street. According to
accounts, there wasn’t nothing playful about that
mix-up.”</p>

<p>“I reckon not,” sighed Pollock regretfully.
“They say the lad that started the rumpus, whoever
he was, got into a corner and held off the
whole bunch for ten minutes. He must be some
scrapper. I got mixed up in a strike riot in Chicago
once, and, believe me, it’s no cinch to stand
off a crowd of roughnecks like that.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the manager. He had
cooled down considerably while the others were
speaking, and was doing some thinking. “Any of
the boys see it?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Buck got a look-in, he was telling us.”</p>

<p>Brennan glanced swiftly down to where Fargo
sat at the end of the table. “How about last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
night, Buck?” he called, in a deceptively mild
tone. “Were you the one who started the rough-house
downtown?”</p>

<p>“Nix on that!” grinned the catcher. “It was
going full blast when I got there. I seen all I
wanted to from the outskirts. The crowd was
plumb crazy. About a hundred of ’em trying to
get at one poor bloke penned in behind the upset
ticket booth. Them that couldn’t get a whack at
him hit somebody else for luck, and a dozen nice
little individual scraps were going on all over the
place.”</p>

<p>“But who was the man?” Brennan persisted.
“Didn’t you see him?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t get a sight of him from the street,”
Fargo answered readily. “The ticket booth was
too high. I run into one of your cubs—Locke’s
his name—trying to get out of the crowd, and we
came home together.”</p>

<p>The manager frowned suspiciously. He knew
Fargo of old, and realized that he was just the
sort of man to be concerned in an affair of this
description. The catcher’s gaze was candid and
open, however, and the closest scrutiny failed to
disclose as much as a scratch on his face.</p>

<p>Brennan’s gaze veered swiftly to the next table,
where his new recruit sat with some of the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
youngsters. Locke looked cool and undisturbed
as he ate his breakfast with evident relish. The
manager’s keen eye discovered a bit of plaster
on one lip and a scratch on one side of his nose;
but, by what Fargo had said about the general
nature of the fighting, those slight abrasions might
easily be accounted for. Besides, Locke did not
strike him as having much of the rowdy in his
make-up.</p>

<p>Without further comment, Brennan fell to on
his breakfast and resumed reading the newspaper
account. When he had finished it, he came to the
conclusion that if one of his men had indeed been
the cause of the disturbance the fellow must be
a scrapper of unusual ability, and would surely
bear upon his person unmistakable marks of the
conflict.</p>

<p>Being a man of action, he at once started the
round of his players. He had no desire to antagonize
the rougher element in Ashland. He
knew perfectly well that this would mean a constant
succession of bickerings, with the possibility
of injury to some of his highclass players if they
got into a fight.</p>

<p>His critical inspection of the men showed the
regulars to be beyond reproach. Not one had
even a slight abrasion for which he could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
account. The majority were provided with plausible
alibis. Of the cubs, three were on the suspicious
list. Locke he had already eliminated, and
so did not bother about him. The other two were
Bert Elgin and a young fielder named Ross, both
of whom—and particularly the first mentioned—bore
telltale signs on their faces.</p>

<p>They told a plausible, well-balanced story:
They had been sitting near the stage of the Palace
Theater when the uproar started back by the door.
They arose with the rest of the audience and
were carried out by the rush of the crowd. When
they finally emerged into the lobby—Elgin swore
that he had left a good-sized piece of skin from
his face on the edge of the door—the place was
filled with men, yelling and fighting like maniacs.
They were so busy forcing their way to the street
that neither had been able to get a look at the
cause of the disturbance. Both were hit several
times in the face, and had naturally smashed back.
On reaching the sidewalk, they had left the place
at once and returned to the hotel.</p>

<p>Brennan was slightly nonplused. The story
rang true. It agreed perfectly, moreover, with
Fargo’s account of the affair, and the manager
knew that his catcher was not at all on friendly
terms with either Elgin or Ross. Lastly, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
confident that neither of them had pugilistic skill
or nerve enough to stand up before such a crowd
after the manner which every account agreed that
the unknown had done.</p>

<p>Puzzled, with a vague feeling that there was
something about it which he did not understand,
Brennan was obliged to content himself with a
strict order that the entire squad forego shows
of any description in the future, under penalty
of heavy fines.</p>

<p>Later in the day he instituted inquiries throughout
the town, with equal lack of success. The
majority of people who had been at the theater
had lost their heads, and could tell him nothing
that he wanted to know. Three men there were
who swore that they had obtained a good look at
the mysterious individual, but their descriptions
were so totally at variance that the manager gave
up his quest in disgust.</p>

<p>“A lot of dough-heads!” he growled. “Sounds
as if they were each describing a different person.”</p>

<p>Which happened to be exactly the truth.</p>

<small>WITHOUT GRATITUDE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Well, it worked all right, kid,” remarked
Buck Fargo as he caught up
with Lefty on the way out to the
field. “I’ll guarantee the old man didn’t even ask
you a question, did he?”</p>

<p>“No. I was waiting for him to brace me, but
it never came off. What the deuce did you tell
him?”</p>

<p>Fargo grinned. “The truth—only not quite all
of it,” he chuckled. “Wonder how our friend
Elgin’s going to get out of it?”</p>

<p>Lefty hazarded no guess. He had more than
a suspicion that his old acquaintance would manage
to evade the responsibility somehow. That
had always been his strong point, for he was not
overburdened with scruples about sticking to the
letter of the truth.</p>

<p>Fargo explained briefly what he had told Brennan,
and then dropped back to his own crowd,
leaving Locke alone. The latter was just turning
into the gate of the field when some one touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
his arm, and, turning, he saw Bert Elgin beside
him, a frown of anxiety on his thin face.</p>

<p>“Look here,” the man began abruptly, “Brennan’s
just put it up to me about last night, and I
had to give him a song and dance to steer him off.
He’s mad as a hornet, and I couldn’t very well
tell him I was mixed up in that fool business. I
wanted to put you wise, so if he asks you, your
story can fit in with mine.”</p>

<p>Locke’s eyes were fixed coldly upon the other’s
face. “And what was the story you told him?”
he asked shortly.</p>

<p>“Said I was down in front with Ross, and got
these scratches getting out of the place. Didn’t
know anything about what started the muss, or
see the fellow who—”</p>

<p>“And you expect me to back you up in this lie?”
Lefty broke in, his eyes narrowing. “You’ve got
another guess coming, Elgin. I came mighty close
to lying for you once, and it’s the last time.”</p>

<p>Elgin’s face darkened. “You’ll blab it all to
him, then?” he burst out. “I might have known
you wouldn’t let slip a chance like this to get back
at me. You always were a—” He stopped abruptly
and bit his lip, a slow flush rising in his
face.</p>

<p>Lefty’s eyes flashed ominously. “Well?” he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
snapped. “Let’s have it. What were you going
to say?”</p>

<p>Elgin’s gaze dropped to the ground, and he
kicked a pebble awkwardly. “Nothing,” he mumbled.
“I—wasn’t thinking—of what—you did for
me last night.”</p>

<p>Lefty’s lips curled scornfully. “Don’t let that
worry you,” he retorted. “I didn’t do it for you.
I did it to save my self-respect, and because you
were one of the boys against a crowd of muckers.
You don’t owe me anything. Get that? I don’t
want you indebted to me. As for this story you
told Brennan, it’s up to you. I won’t go out of
my way to put him right, but if he asks me questions
I’ll tell him the truth.”</p>

<p>Elgin threw back his head, furious under the
lashing contempt of the other’s voice.</p>

<p>“If you’re such a good little boy,” he sneered,
“how do you explain traveling under a name
which isn’t yours? Strikes me that’s a lie, all
right.”</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” returned Lefty curtly.
“Anything more?”</p>

<p>“No,” snarled Elgin; “but if Brennan gets wise
through you, I’ll settle your hash for good and
all.”</p>

<p>Lefty shrugged his shoulders indifferently.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
“Try it,” he laughed. “If you don’t have any
better luck than you did the last time, I guess I’ll
survive.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned and
walked across the field, leaving Elgin glaring after
him in speechless rage.</p>

<p>For a moment or two Lefty was conscious of
an unpleasant feeling, more like a bad taste in
the mouth than anything else. He had not really
expected any fulsome expressions of gratitude
from Bert Elgin. He was quite sincere in not
wishing the man to feel indebted to him in the
slightest. And yet, inconsequentially enough,
when it was all over he could not help wondering
how any one could be so lacking in a sense of decency.
At least the fellow could have kept his
mouth shut, if nothing else.</p>

<p>The whole matter was swept swiftly out of his
mind, however. Brennan, still somewhat peevish
at his lack of success in reaching the bottom of
the riot affair, was decidedly short of temper, and
he started the day’s practice with a rush and vim
which kept everybody on the jump.</p>

<p>“Get a hustle on you, Locke!” he snapped, as
Lefty approached at a dogtrot. “I want to see
what some of the cubs can do with a stick,” he
went on, in a lower tone. “Get out there and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
loosen up a bit; a little smoke, you know. You
was full enough of it yesterday.”</p>

<p>Lefty caught the ball with outward calm, but as
he turned and walked out to the pitcher’s box he
groaned to himself. He had been hoping that he
might be spared this to-day, for he had a bruise
on his left shoulder as big as a silver dollar, and his
whole upper body was stiff and sore from last
night’s experience.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but grin and bear it,
however, unless he wanted to rouse Brennan’s suspicions.
While the cub batters were being
gathered in, he tried warming up a little, but had
no more than sent two balls over before he was
brought up sharply by the manager’s roar:</p>

<p>“Stop that, and get down to business!”</p>

<p>The first delivery went so high that the cub backstop
had difficulty in pulling it down. The second
was equally erratic. Lefty flashed a swift glance
at the stocky manager, whose face was set in a
fierce scowl, and decided that he would have to take
a brace at any cost.</p>

<p>With an effort which sent a stinging twinge of
pain through his bruised shoulder, he whipped
over a speedy straight one, which the batter
missed, following it by a drop that was quite as
deceptive. Brennan’s scowl relaxed slightly, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
more than once during the succeeding twenty
minutes it deepened again; for Lefty managed to
intersperse wild pitches with good ones in a manner
which could not help being exasperating to one
who knew nothing of the cause.</p>

<p>“That’ll do!” growled the manager, at length.
“You’re a winner, you are! What’s the matter
with you to-day?”</p>

<p>Lefty mumbled some excuse about not feeling
very fit, and Brennan’s lips curled. “Huh!” he
snorted. “Delicate, are you? Rot! Hey, Cy,
come over and give this cub a few lessons in first
principles.”</p>

<p>There was a general grin from the watching
group of cubs, and Lefty felt his cheeks burn. He
recovered himself swiftly, however, and, at Brennan’s
order, took his place with the batters. The
fact that he smashed out a clean single the first
time he was up before the Hornet’s star pitcher
went far toward restoring his own self-respect,
even though it had no visible effect on the Argus-eyed
manager.</p>

<p>Once during the course of the morning’s work
Lefty caught Buck Fargo’s eyes fixed upon him,
and as he was leaving the park toward noon the
big backstop stepped out from the group of
regulars and came over to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Looks like you were getting in bad with the
old man,” he remarked seriously. “First impressions
go a long distance with him. I’ve been thinking
mebbe we made a mistake in keeping quiet
about last night. He’d roar for a bit, but he
couldn’t sling it into you like he would if you’d
started that rough-house.”</p>

<p>“You think it would be a good idea to tell him?”
Lefty asked gravely.</p>

<p>“That would put him wise to what was the matter
with you.”</p>

<p>The cub pitcher’s lips twitched. “Don’t you
think it would be more sport to see if he could
find it out by himself?” he suggested.</p>

<p>Fargo let out a guffaw and brought one fist
down on Locke’s shoulder with a force which made
him wince.</p>

<p>“For a cub, you ain’t half bad, kid,” he
chuckled.</p>

<p>That was all he said. The next instant he had
turned away and rejoined his companions, leaving
Lefty to jog on back to the hotel alone.</p>

<p>But somehow, though he was alone, the cub was
far from feeling that depressing isolation of the
day before. The morning seemed to have been
spent principally in stirring up an old enmity and
getting in bad with the manager. But these things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
did not worry the bush pitcher as they might have
done if he had not fancied that he had also made a
friend, and one who was well worth while.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>THE MAN WHO KNEW</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Lefty had barely stepped inside the
Hatchford Hotel lobby when some one
leaped at him like a human whirlwind, and
a vaguely familiar voice chortled in his ear:</p>

<p>“Well, you old lobster! If I’m not glad to see
your ugly mug again! Put it there, old fellow!”</p>

<p>Whirling swiftly, Locke saw standing before him
a short, slim, wiry chap of about his own age, with
a deeply tanned and freckled face, and a big mouth
stretched to its utmost in a wide grin of delight.</p>

<p>“Jack Stillman!” he exclaimed joyously, grabbing
the outstretched hand. “Well, what do you
know about this! Last time I ran into you was on
Broadway, over a year ago. What the mischief
are you doing down here?”</p>

<p>“That’s easy. I’m the only original live wire
on the sporting page of the <cite>Star</cite>. Ran down to
look over Jim Brennan’s live stock and give the
fans something to think about. You don’t mean to
say you’re one of ’em, Phil?”</p>

<p>“Guessed right the first crack, Jack,” Lefty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
laughed. “You always were an awful clever
boy.”</p>

<p>“But how the deuce— I didn’t even know
you’d taken up baseball. Thought you were
scratching away in a lawyer’s office.”</p>

<p>“So I was until last spring. I played the season
under the name of Lefty Locke. It’s a long
story, but—”</p>

<p>Stillman’s eyes widened. “You’re Locke?”
he exclaimed interestedly. “Wouldn’t that get
you? I heard a few things about his pitching out
in the bush last summer, but I hadn’t any idea you
were it. Let’s have the yarn. Any good copy in
it?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” Lefty said hastily. “Come on
upstairs and I’ll tell you the story of my life while
I’m making myself respectable.”</p>

<p>The newspaper man accepted with alacrity, and
when they reached Lefty’s room he made himself
comfortable while the latter proceeded with his
toilet and the recital of the summer’s doings at the
same time.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame that Blue Stocking scout showed
up just too late,” Stillman said regretfully. “Of
course Jimmy Brennan is all right. He’s got
more baseball under that dome of his than most
managers in the country, and if you get in right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
you’ll be all to the merry. I’d hate like thunder to
lose that coin though. Any more cub twirlers in
the outfit?”</p>

<p>“Bert Elgin,” Lefty returned quietly.</p>

<p>Stillman stared, and an expression of incredulity
flashed into his face. “What?” he gasped.
“Not—”</p>

<p>Locke nodded. “The same. Funny, isn’t it, we
should run up against each other this way?”</p>

<p>“Funny? I don’t see it. The cur!”</p>

<p>Lefty turned swiftly from the bureau, a queer
look on his face. “Just what do you mean by that,
Jack?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p>Stillman snorted. “You know very well what I
mean,” he retorted forcibly. “I’m not supposed
to be wise, but Bob Ferris told me the whole story,
and it’s my opinion you were blamed fools to keep
still about it. Any man who’ll steal from one college
mate and then deliberately work to throw the
blame on another isn’t fit for decent fellows to associate
with. When you had him where you
wanted him, why didn’t you come out with it, and
let everybody know what kind of a mucker he
was?”</p>

<p>Lefty slipped into his coat, and dropped down
beside his friend.</p>

<p>“You know why we didn’t,” he said quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
“He’d have been fired, and the varsity would have
lost about every other game that season. You
don’t suppose it was on Elgin’s account we kept
still after we’d found how he was trying to throw
the blame on me?”</p>

<p>“I’m not quite a fool. All the same, you were
wrong. We might have dropped a game or two,
but you could have jumped into his place, all
right.”</p>

<p>“You know I couldn’t. I was slaving about ten
hours a day to make up work I missed on account
of that beastly typhoid. How long would I have
lasted at Princeton if I tried to play ball, too?
No; Bob and I thrashed it all out, and, though it
came mighty hard, we decided it was the only thing
to do, unless we wanted the team beaten to a frazzle.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come out with it the next
year?” demanded Stillman. “You could have
pitched then, all right.”</p>

<p>“That would have looked fine, wouldn’t it?
How would we have accounted for keeping quiet so
long? I will say, Jack, that we were both sorry
more than once afterward; but, having started
out, there was nothing else to do but keep on. I
don’t see how Bob came to tell you. It was understood
that we should keep it entirely to ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“It wasn’t till a year after we’d graduated,” the
reporter explained, his face still clouded. “It was
one right at the Princeton Club. I don’t remember
just how the subject came up. I suppose he
thought there wasn’t any need of keeping still any
longer.” He paused and glanced at his companion.
“How’s he acted since you showed up?
Same old Elgin, I suppose?”</p>

<p>For an instant Lefty hesitated. He could picture
Stillman’s sarcastic reception of the story of
the night before, and, knowing his friend’s impulsive,
quick-tempered nature, he decided that it
would be wisest to keep silent.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t overjoyed to see me,” he returned
quietly.</p>

<p>The newspaper man arose. “I should say
not!” he commented briefly. “Afraid you’ll let
the other fellows know what sort of a rotter he is.
If I were in your place, I’d be hanged if I
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Where would be the sense?” Lefty retorted.
“It was all over and done with years ago. Of
course, if he should try anything like the same
game again, it would be different. You’re not
thinking of—”</p>

<p>“It’s none of my business,” Stillman put in.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
“I don’t want to have anything to do with the
mucker. Let’s go down to dinner.”</p>

<p>As luck would have it, stepping out of the elevator,
they came face to face with Bert Elgin himself,
talking earnestly with big Bill Hagin, a regular
outfielder. For an instant the former stared
blankly at Stillman. Then, with a great affectation
of heartiness, he thrust out a hand.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged if it isn’t Jack Stillman!”
he exclaimed. “Glad to see you, old hoss!”</p>

<p>The reporter made no attempt to withdraw his
hands from his pockets. He seemed, in fact, to
thrust them deeper, and as his eyes met Elgin’s
there was a look of withering, contemptuous scorn
in them, which cut the ball player like a knife.</p>

<p>“How are you, Elgin?” he said curtly, and
passed on toward the dining room with Lefty.</p>

<p>For a second Elgin stood staring after them,
his face flushed and his eyes gleaming angrily.</p>

<p>“Your friend don’t seem choked with joy at seeing
you,” Hagin commented maliciously.</p>

<p>Elgin came to himself with a slight start, and
shrugged his shoulders indifferently. “No special
friend of mine,” he said shortly. “Used to
see him now and then three years ago.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when he dropped into his place at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the table a short time later, his face was still
flushed and angry.</p>

<p>“Stillman was friendly enough at Princeton,”
he thought furiously. “That dog has turned him
against me with his lying stories, that’s what’s
happened.” He ground his teeth viciously. “If
I don’t put it all over him, good and proper, I’m
a liar!”</p>

<small>SOMETHING SUB-ROSA</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Five-inning practice game at eight-thirty
sharp,” announced Manager
Brennan, at the close of the day’s work.</p>

<p>Instantly every tongue stopped wagging, and
each man turned an eager, inquiring face in his
direction. After nearly two weeks of monotonous
training, the prospect of a real game, even if it
was only among themselves, was very welcome.</p>

<p>The new recruits, especially, quivered with anticipation.
It was a foregone conclusion that the
game would be played between the regulars and the
“Yannigans,” as the cubs are sometimes termed;
and the chance of pitting themselves against their
more experienced rivals thrilled each one of the
youngsters through and through.</p>

<p>The older men were more indifferent. They
had played many such games in past training seasons,
and knew that these were organized by the
manager mainly for the purpose of watching the
cubs in action and studying their possibilities.
Still, there would be a chance to try their hitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
skill against the bush pitchers, and any ball
player will willingly go without a meal in order to
bat.</p>

<p>“You can try your hand at being field captain
to-morrow, Cy,” Brennan said, glancing at Russell,
“and make up your own team.” He pulled
a pencil and rumpled piece of paper from his
pocket and turned his attention to the expectant
youngsters. “We’ll see how you make out bossing
a team, Ogan,” he went on, as his eyes lighted
on the promising young first baseman from Ohio.
“I’ll want these men to start in playing. Afterward
you’ll use your own judgment about keeping
them in the game.”</p>

<p>He began calling out the names of nine cubs,
with the positions they were to take, jotting them
down as he did so. When he finished with the
words, “Whalen, catcher, and Locke on the slab,”
Lefty beamed.</p>

<p>He had worked hard for two days to atone for
the bad impression he had made at first, and this
looked as if he had succeeded. “And I’ll do even
better to-morrow,” he resolved, tossing up his
glove in sheer exuberance of spirits. “I’ll try to
show him Toler wasn’t such a bad judge of pitchers,
after all.”</p>

<p>A glimpse of Bert Elgin’s scowling face only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
added to Lefty’s good spirits, and he departed
from the field feeling very cheerful indeed.</p>

<p>At the supper table Jim Brennan was conspicuous
by his absence, and curious inquiries revealed
the fact that he had taken a late afternoon train
to Fort Worth, from which he did not expect to
return until early morning. “Pop” Jennings,
the oldest and most settled pitcher in the organization,
was the source of this information. He
added that he had been left in charge of the squad,
and hoped he would not have to break too many
heads to keep order.</p>

<p>The announcement caused no immediate effect
beyond a certain noticeable relaxation. There
were a few more or less joshing remarks concerning
Pop’s new job, but they were comparatively
mild. Before entering the field of professional
baseball Jennings had dallied with the four-ounce
gloves to an extent which gave him something of a
reputation in sporting circles on the Pacific coast.
He was noted for a dogged determination to carry
out orders at any cost—a trait which made him
invaluable at the crucial moment of a hard-fought
game. The players had learned from experience
that there would be no slurring of Brennan’s instructions,
and that any laxity of training would
bring with it swift retribution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Happily, Pop had a praiseworthy habit of retiring
promptly at nine o’clock. Jesters said
it was because he was getting old and had to be
careful of himself. The truth was that Jennings,
raised on a farm, had been imbued from earliest
years with the value of the old adage, “Early to
bed, early to rise,” and couldn’t help himself.</p>

<p>During the early part of the evening the behavior
of the Hornets was unexceptionable. Some
lounged in the lobby, reading papers, or chatting
lazily. Most of the cubs were gathered in a corner,
discussing the morrow’s game, and perfecting
a system of signals for use on the field. Quite
a number of the regulars, gathered about the pool
tables, indulged in an innocent game of penny
ante, or shot craps. A few drifted off early to
their rooms. Pop, making a round of inspection
a little before nine, decided that all were harmlessly
employed, and departed to bed.</p>

<p>Instantly the click of cues and balls ceased, card
games languished, and a state of general restiveness
ensued. Lefty and two or three companions,
who had drifted in a few minutes before from the
lobby, wondered what was going to happen. They
were not kept waiting long. At the end of fifteen
minutes Bill Hagin sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“He’s safe,” he announced. “Come on up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
my room, fellows. It’s the whole length of the
house from his, and we can have a little racket
without his getting wise.”</p>

<p>The response was instantaneous, for the Hornets,
as a crowd, were nothing if not lively.
Every regular in the room arose promptly and
started toward the door. The three or four cubs
present followed more slowly. They had been
long enough with the organization to learn the
wisdom of not being too pushing.</p>

<p>Hagin, glancing back from the doorway, sensed
the situation, and grinned. “Everybody come
along,” he invited good-humoredly. “We’ll
teach you kids the first principles of draw poker.”</p>

<p>His remark was general, but his eyes happened
to rest lightly on the face of Lefty Locke in a
manner which was distinctly challenging. Now,
Locke was a very normal young chap, and the tone
of condescension rasped him slightly. He fancied
he played pretty good poker, and had an idea that
even the famous Hornets couldn’t show him a
whole lot about the game. Consequently he accepted
the invitation with alacrity, and was presently
seated at a table in the big double room which
Hagin shared with one of the other members of
the team.</p>

<p>Buck Fargo was on one side of him and Pollock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the red-headed shortstop, on the other. Cigars
were produced and lighted, cards appeared,
and presently, amid the babble of talk and laughter,
Hagin’s voice sounded:</p>

<p>“What’ll you have to drink, fellows? Speak
up sharp, now; the boy’s waiting.”</p>

<p>As he cut for deal Lefty glanced up and saw
one of the hotel bell boys standing near the door,
order-blank in hand. From the character and
number of the drinks he put down, it became
swiftly evident that the crowd was certainly making
the most of Jim Brennan’s absence. Calls for
high-balls, fizzes, gin-rickeys, whisky straights,
beers, and ales came from every side. If there
were any scattering orders for soft drinks, Lefty
did not hear them. The Hornets seemed to agree
with Red Pollock that “them soft slops was the
worst things a man could put into his stummick.”</p>

<p>When his turn came to order, Locke hesitated
an instant. With the examples set him on every
side by men so much more experienced in the
game, he need scarcely feel any compunction in
taking something he was used to in moderation.
A single glass could scarcely do him any harm.</p>

<p>“Light beer,” he said, at length.</p>

<p>Glancing hurriedly over his cards, he quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
missed the odd side glance which Buck Fargo
flashed at him. But perhaps it was not meant
for him to see.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>“WHEN THE CAT’S AWAY”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The liquid refreshments arrived while they
were in the midst of an unusually animated
hand. Everybody had dropped out
but Cy Russell, Siegrist, the first baseman, and
Lefty. The latter, with three kings and a pair of
tens, was half conscious that Fargo had taken a
glass from the tray and set it down beside him. It
was one of those cases, however, where one gets an
impression without really seeing, and he could not
have told afterward whether it was actually the
big backstop who put it down, or the waiter. And
when it came to that, he did not notice whether it
was the hotel employee himself who held the tray,
or some one else.</p>

<p>He played his hand for all there was in it, and
won the good-sized jackpot. Siegrist groaned as
he flung down three queens and a pair of eights.</p>

<p>Russell shoved over the chips with a grimace.
“I was trying to get by with two pair, aces up.
You don’t work that innocent-appearing face on
me again, kid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>Lefty chuckled and took a long drink from the
glass as he shuffled the cards to deal. The beer
had an unusual flavor, and he sipped it again, trying
to make out what was the matter with it.
“Bum stuff,” he reflected. “Tastes sort of
queer.”</p>

<p>As the game progressed, however, he gradually
drained the glass without thinking much about it.
He was having unusual luck, and played his cards
with a skill which put him away in the lead of the
others.</p>

<p>Presently Hagin sauntered up to the table.
“What’ll you have, boys?” he asked. “Time for
a second round.”</p>

<p>Most of them ordered; one or two declined,
among them Lefty.</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” Locke said firmly, when Hagin
pressed him. “I’ve had enough.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you <em>have</em> had enough,” put in Buck
Fargo, in a tone which seemed so significant that
the cub pitcher glanced swiftly at him. The big
backstop was busy with his cards, and did not
look up; but Lefty noticed that his face was oddly
serious. He noticed also the half-emptied glass
of seltzer standing beside Fargo’s scanty pile of
chips, and a sudden qualm struck him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shouldn’t have taken that beer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
after all,” he said to himself. “I thought everybody
was drinking something in that line.”</p>

<p>A quick survey of the table told him that everybody
else was, and, somewhat reassured, he went
on with the game. Perhaps the catcher was a
little peevish because he was losing so heavily.
Adversity at cards brings out the good and bad
points of a man’s character better than almost
anything else.</p>

<p>The game progressed. More drinks were
brought, more cigars produced and lighted. No
one got befuddled, for the Hornets were a hard-headed
crowd, and each one knew his limit; but
there was a general warming up throughout the
room. Joshing and laughter sounded continuously.
Now and then some one would burst into
song, only to be sat upon instantly by three or
four others. The tobacco smoke hung in a thick
pall midway between ceiling and floor, stirred fitfully
by soft breezes from the open windows.</p>

<p>For a time Lefty continued to win. Then gradually
luck seemed to turn against him. He still
held much the same run of cards, but several times
he made bad errors in judgment. Presently he
became conscious of an extraordinary sensation
of lightness in his head, like nothing else he had
ever experienced. It was not especially disagreeable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
On the contrary, it seemed as if his senses
had become suddenly more acute, as if he could
play two small pairs so cleverly that he would
bluff out stronger hands. Instead, he lost, and
kept on losing.</p>

<p>It was most puzzling and annoying. He could
not understand it. That first odd exhilaration
passed in a little while, and was succeeded by a
dull depression. His head began to ache. Was
it the smoke? he wondered. Several times he
caught one of the fellows eyeing him curiously,
and it brought him up with a jerk, determined to
stick it out and let no one know there was anything
the matter with him.</p>

<p>How long it continued he never knew. For
seeming hours he went on his raw nerve, playing
the cards dealt to him instinctively, his whole
being occupied in fighting off a clogging sensation
which constantly threatened his brain like a smothering
blanket.</p>

<p>It was Buck Fargo who made the first move to
break up, and Lefty could have hugged him had
he not been so taken up in keeping a grip upon his
consciousness.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, I’m going to hit the downy,” the
big backstop announced, with a cavernous yawn.
“Let’s settle up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>There were protests, of course; but Fargo was
firm.</p>

<p>Released from the tension of playing, Lefty sat
stupidly staring at the three red chips in front
of him. He was aroused by Russell’s voice:
“Come across with seventeen bucks, Locke. You
made a bad finish.”</p>

<p>Without a word, the cub pitcher fumbled in his
pocket and drew forth a roll of bills. The numbers
in the corners were blurred and indistinct.
He picked out several at random, tossed them on
the table, gathered in the change Russell handed
him, and arose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood gripping the chairback.
The room was going around; the floor tilted dangerously.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, kid?” came in Fargo’s
voice. “You look sort of funny.”</p>

<p>Lefty straightened himself with a great effort.
“Nothing,” he said, with laboriously distinct
enunciation. “I’ve got a sort of headache. The
bad air, I guess.”</p>

<p>Then the men drifted over to the other table,
bent on breaking up the game there, and Locke
was left alone. He had given up wondering what
was the matter with him. His one thought was
to get out of the room while he could. Slowly he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
turned and faced the door. A shout of laughter,
followed by the sounds of a good-natured rough-house,
told him that the attention of the others
was occupied for the moment. He let go his hold
on the chair, reeled, recovered himself with an
effort, and, with set teeth, slowly, laboriously
crossed the room.</p>

<p>It seemed an eternity before his hand touched
the panels and fumbled for the knob. The next
he knew he was in the still darkness of the hall,
steadying himself against the wall. Somewhere
in his head a sledge hammer was beating on an
anvil. He wondered hazily how long flesh and
bone could stand it. He took a step forward.
Where was his room? Was it on this floor or the
next?</p>

<p>At last he remembered, and began a slow, painful
progress down the hall. Several times before
reaching the stairs he fell, but at last he struck
the bottom step and began to crawl up on hands
and knees.</p>

<p>His room was directly opposite the elevator, or
he would never have reached it. The door was,
luckily, unlocked, and he managed to step in and
close it behind him. As his finger instinctively
pressed the electric button close at hand, flooding
the room with light, he gave a sudden stifled cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>He was to pitch to-morrow in the first practice
game of the season. The remembrance stabbed
through his fading senses like a knife. He had
meant to show Brennan what there was in him.
He had planned to strain every effort in order
that the manager should forget his first unfortunate
fiasco. And now—</p>

<p>He groaned aloud. Then, with a long, shuddering
sigh, he felt his legs crumple under him. A
black curtain fell before his eyes.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>ALL IN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When Lefty came to himself the electric
lights were still blazing in sickly
opposition to the bright sunshine
which poured through the two windows. For a
moment or two he lay wondering what had happened
and why he was stretched out on the floor,
fully dressed. Then the dull, throbbing pain in
his head brought him to a sitting posture, with a
groan.</p>

<p>He glanced at the bed and saw that it was untouched.
He looked up dazedly at the cluster of
lights, then down at his rumpled shirtfront. The
glitter of his gold fob caught his eye, and, with
an effort, he pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five minutes to eight,” he muttered.
“Time I was getting—”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and drew his breath with
a swift intake as he remembered. The game was
to begin at eight-thirty. He was to pitch for the
Yannigans!</p>

<p>Staggering to his feet, he went over to the washstand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
and plunged his face into a hurriedly drawn
bowl of water. Nothing had ever felt so good
before. He dashed it on his hair, regardless of
the streams running over his shirtfront. Again
and again he dropped his face back into the grateful,
cooling contents of the bowl before he finally
reached for a rough towel.</p>

<p>He remembered everything now—the absence of
Brennan, the adjournment to Hagin’s room, the
cards, the smoke, the drinks, and—last of all—that
horrible attack which had come upon him.</p>

<p>What had brought it about? It couldn’t have
been the beer. That was wretched stuff, to be
sure, but a single glass of it would hardly produce
such an effect. He had thrown his coat hastily
to one side and was ripping the collar from his
neck when suddenly he stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“Doped!” he exclaimed, aloud.</p>

<p>It was an almost incredible supposition, but it
explained everything perfectly. No single glass
of ordinary beer could have the effect of that one
upon a man in Lefty’s splendid physical condition,
and there was the odd, repulsive flavor which he
had set down to the poor quality of the brew.</p>

<p>But who would do such a thing—and why?
Locke’s first thought was of Bert Elgin, but the
fellow had not even been in the room. Hagin had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
no motive—or, so far as he knew, any opportunity.
Who else, then, could have been responsible?</p>

<p>The answer did not come readily, for Lefty’s
mind was working only by fits and starts as he
flung his clothes right and left, threw a dressing
gown over his shoulders, and darted down the
hall to the shower which Brennan had caused to be
put in for the benefit of his men. The tingling reaction
of his blood under the icy spray meant much
more to him than breakfast, for an intolerable lassitude
seemed to grip his limbs, while the very
thought of food was almost nauseating.</p>

<p>Lingering under the shower as long as he dared,
he dashed back to his room and began to drag on
his baseball clothes. It was not until he was
buckling his belt, however, that the significance of
Buck Fargo’s remark when Lefty refused the second
glass of beer came to him: “I reckon you
<em>have</em> had enough.” Why had he said that? Was
it because he knew that the first glass was quite
sufficient to do the business? There had been
more to the big backstop’s tone, somehow, than
just plain, casual agreement.</p>

<p>“Rot!” snapped Locke, snatching up cap and
glove and making for the door. “I’m loony! He
hasn’t a single motive, and, besides, he’s not the
sort of chap who’d do a dirty thing like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the thought returned to torment
him at odd moments during the hasty choking
down of a little breakfast, followed by the jog out
to the field—and afterward. It was the bitter
disappointment and humiliation of that afterward,
which Lefty never forgot.</p>

<p>The cubs were in high spirits, eager for the
chance to win their spurs. As he watched their
antics on the way out to the park, Lefty felt a
pang of envy. He would have given anything to
have that same snap and ginger, instead of feeling
the lassitude and weariness which gripped him.</p>

<p>Several of his teammates asked if he wasn’t
feeling well, but he forced a laugh, and put them
off. He would rather have died than give up his
place to Bert Elgin. When the time came for
him to go into the box surely he would brace up
and be more himself.</p>

<p>Halfway out to the field Andy Whalen, the cub
catcher, came up, and they discussed briefly the
signals which had been talked over the night before.
Lefty wished desperately that he had gone
off to bed directly afterward, instead of strolling
into the pool room and allowing himself to be
drawn into that game in Hagin’s room.</p>

<p>Regrets were unavailing, however. Though
some one had given him the double cross, Lefty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
realized that he alone was to blame for making
the opportunity. Then and there he registered a
silent vow that nothing under heaven should ever
again induce him to deviate a hair’s breadth from
his manager’s rules of training. And then he
wondered whether that resolution had been made
too late.</p>

<p>The teams had ten minutes’ practice in which to
warm up; then the coin was tossed. The Yannigans
won, and, choosing the field, romped gayly
out to their positions, tossing up gloves, yelling
persiflage at one another, and altogether behaving
coltishly.</p>

<p>Lefty was with them, but not of them. He had
never in his life felt in poorer condition for pitching.
His head ached, and he was as tired and
drooping as if he had not slept in forty-eight
hours. But he could not bring himself to beg off,
and there was no other way out. He caught the
ball from Brennan, who acted as umpire, shot a
swift, appraising glance at the manager’s impenetrable
face, and then took the signal from Whalen.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<small>LEFTY’S FAILURE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The call was for a curve ball, and Lefty
did his best to respond. Unfortunately
he put so much curve into it that the
sphere missed the plate by at least two feet.
Whalen looked surprised, but said nothing.
Lefty felt the blood rushing into his face and
making his head pound more than ever.</p>

<p>The backstop then signaled for a fast straight
ball, indicating with one hand that it was to cross
the batter’s shoulders. It was straight enough,
but woefully lacking in speed, and Carl Siegrist
promptly hit it on the trademark and dusted to
first.</p>

<p>Had this been a championship game, the rangy
infielder, who had hit well over three hundred for
several seasons, would have made it good for two
bags, or even three. Siegrist, like all the other
old men, did not believe in straining himself unduly,
however. He took things easy, and camped
on the initial sack.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” snapped Ogan, from first. “What
in Sam Hill’s the matter with you, Locke?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” chimed in Tom Burley, at short; “this
isn’t croquet. Wake up.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a little of that smoke you had up
your sleeve the other day,” added the third baseman.</p>

<p>Lefty made no reply to these remarks. He was
watching Brennan’s face as the manager left the
plate to take up his position behind the pitcher.
Brennan looked anything but pleased, and, though
he made no remark, Locke fancied he knew what
was passing through his mind.</p>

<p>The next batter drew two balls in succession,
and then created a momentary respite for Lefty
by flying out to center field. His successor, however,
smashed the first pitched ball over the infield,
and romped down the line amid a howl of
delight from the regulars, whose interest in the
game was warming up.</p>

<p>Instantly a gatling fire of sarcasm was turned
on Lefty by his teammates. Ogan raced into the
diamond and caught the pitcher’s arm.</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re doing?” he hissed
fiercely. “Are you trying to throw the game
away?”</p>

<p>Lefty shook his head. His face was white now,
his eye desperate. He knew he was making a miserable
exhibition. He should not have started; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
should have gone to Ogan before the game and told
him he wasn’t in fit condition to pitch. His head
was splitting so that he could scarcely see. He
seemed to have no strength left in his arm.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’d better take me out, Al,” he
muttered. “I seem to be on the fritz.”</p>

<p>“You bet you are!” retorted the captain hotly.
Then, catching a glimpse of Lefty’s wretched face,
he hesitated an instant. “I’ll give you one more
chance, Locke,” he went on shortly. “If you
don’t make good, out you go. I’m not going to
have this game handed over on a silver tray if I
can help it. You’ve got the goods, Locke; brace
up and hand ’em out.”</p>

<p>When Ogan had gone back to his position, Lefty
turned and glanced at the plate. His heart sank
when he saw that Buck Fargo stood there, swinging
his bat negligently. Nevertheless, with set
teeth, the southpaw toed the rubber and pitched.</p>

<p>It was a straight, high ball that cut the plate in
half, and Brennan’s voice droned out “Strike!”
as the batter let it pass. Lefty was heartened,
and, at a signal from Whalen, he tried an outcurve.
As before, this curved too far out even
to cut a corner. Another ball followed, and then
another strike. Then Fargo swung above a drop
ball, and was declared out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>As the big backstop tossed his bat aside and
strolled, grinning, to the bench, there was a sigh
of relief from the Yannigan infield. Perhaps
their pitcher was taking an almost-despaired-of
brace. One or two gave voice to brief words of
commendation; but Lefty did not hear them. He
was staring after Fargo in a puzzled way. No
one knew better than he—unless it was Andy
Whalen—how far those deliveries had fallen short
of his usual form. He could not understand why
Buck had failed to make connections.</p>

<p>There was no time to think of that, however,
for Bill Hagin was strutting to the plate. To
Lefty his expression seemed more cocky and self-assured
than ever, and the bush pitcher felt a
sudden ardent longing to send him back to the
bench as his predecessor had gone.</p>

<p>Whalen signaled for a drop, but Lefty had
watched Hagin batting the day before, and felt
that a straight, speedy one, placed high, would
bother him more. He notified the catcher to that
effect, toed the rubber, tried to forget his pounding
head, gathered every muscle for the effort, and
pitched.</p>

<p>The horsehide whirled toward the plate with
speed enough, but crossed it a good foot below
where Lefty intended. The bat met it squarely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
with every ounce of the big fielder’s muscle behind
it, and Lefty uttered a stifled groan of despairing
surrender as the regulars began to circle the bases
blithely.</p>

<p>What had gone before was as nothing to the
roar which rose from the cubs when they saw
three grinning players jog, one after the other,
across the plate. As one man, they turned on
Lefty and poured out the vials of their wrath in
vivid, soul-stirring, mouth-filling phrases, which
left absolutely nothing to the imagination.</p>

<p>Interspersed with these gusts of abuse were yells
of: “Take him out! Take—him—out!” which
were quite unnecessary. Lefty realized that he
was done for, and did not even glance toward Ogan
as he walked toward the bench. He heard the latter’s
angry voice, however, yelling after him:
“Get off the field, you boneheaded quitter!” And
that seemed to hurt more than anything else.</p>

<p>He wasn’t a quitter. He had done his best, and
it was not his fault that he had failed. No doubt
he should never have gone out there at all, but
how many of those others, face to face with the
alternative he had met that morning, would have
decided differently?</p>

<p>Head down and hands tightly clenched, he made
his way toward the bench, not even looking up as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
he passed Bert Elgin, racing out to take his place.
He flung himself down on the turf and lay there,
chin propped in his cupped hands, eyes staring
blindly out across the diamond.</p>

<p>More than once the regulars glanced curiously
in his direction, but no one spoke. A little later,
when the Yannigans trooped in, having succeeded
in holding down the score, Lefty fully expected a
storm of bitter reproaches to be hurled at him;
but nothing came. The fellows took their places
on the bench or the coaching lines without so much
as a glance toward the chap lying there on the
grass. For all the attention they paid to him, he
might have been a log of wood.</p>

<p>As inning after inning passed amid that same
studied silence and marked avoidance, Lefty felt
that he would rather have endured sneers, blows,
anything else. His head still throbbed and
he was feeling wretched, mentally and physically.
He was a fool not to have left the field at once;
but, being there, his innate stubbornness kept him
to the end.</p>

<p>Presently Jack Stillman came up and chatted
casually for a minute or two, but Lefty was so
mortally averse to pity that his replies were short
almost to ungraciousness; and the reporter walked
away, a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>By dint of fast, strenuous playing on the part
of the cubs, assisted by the easy-going ways of
their opponents, the regulars were kept from
further scoring, while the Yannigans made two
tallies before the end of the last inning. But for
Locke’s errors they would have won the game.
The realization did not tend toward soothing their
ruffled spirits.</p>

<p>As the teams mingled on the field at the end of
the fifth inning, the one crowd grinning and joshing,
the other responding with defensive sarcasm,
Lefty caught an angry glare from more than one
pair of eyes among the disappointed youngsters.</p>

<p>“I s’pose they all have it in for me,” he muttered.</p>

<p>The next instant he saw Jim Brennan bearing
down upon him, his face more florid than ever, his
sharp eyes glinting.</p>

<p>“Good night!” the southpaw murmured.
“Here’s my finish.”</p>

<p>Instinctively he rose to his feet and stood there,
nervously juggling his glove, his eyes fixed upon
the approaching manager, waiting for the storm to
break.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<small>THE DISCHARGED WAITER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Lefty drew one sleeve across his perspiring
face, and stared at the square, sturdy
back of the retreating manager.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he muttered. “And then some!”</p>

<p>On second thought, he withdrew the comment.
Jim Brennan had left nothing to be said, nothing
to the imagination. In stinging phrases, which
bit like acid and made the pitcher wince and grit
his teeth, he had told his latest recruit exactly
what he thought of such a disgrace among ball
players.</p>

<p>He applied to Locke every epithet in his repertory—he
had a vocabulary the width and breadth
and startling nature of which was unusual even
among Big League managers—and Lefty was
obliged to stand there and swallow everything.
He had nothing to say, no excuse to make for his
behavior. He might have explained everything
by telling Brennan of the glass of beer which he
was certain had been drugged. But that would
have put the whole crowd in bad, and Lefty was
no telltale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>So he set his jaws, clenched his fists, and took
everything the manager had to say, fully expecting
the tirade to end in his being thrown out of
the squad.</p>

<p>When Brennan finally concluded his spirited
monologue with a pyrotechnic burst to the effect
that he proposed taking the blankety-blank bonehead
personally in hand the next morning for the
purpose of beating a little elemental baseball into
his thick skull, and then strode away with eyebrows
twitching, it was a full minute before Lefty
realized that it had not come. He had not been
fired!</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” he exclaimed aloud, his
eyebrows drawn together in a puzzled frown.
“Why didn’t he do it? What use can he have for
me after to-day?”</p>

<p>For a while he stood there, trying to fathom the
reason. Then he gave it up and started for the
gate. The others had long since left the park,
and he made his way back to the hotel alone, took
his shower, and came down to the dining-room ten
minutes late.</p>

<p>For all the comfort he got out of his companions
Lefty might as well have been alone at the table.
From the beginning of the meal to its long-drawn-out
finish not a single word was addressed directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
to him. The others talked over him, around him,
at him, but never to him. Among themselves, but
in tones which plainly showed that their remarks
were aimed at Lefty, they discussed that miserable
first inning in detail, pointing out how different
the result would have been with any one but a
quitter in the box. They made many other scornful
comments, and the southpaw was hard pressed
to maintain a stolid, impassive demeanor. Not
for the world would he have them guess how much
they were hurting him.</p>

<p>By supper time the determined ostracism of his
cub companions had so worked on Lefty that his
nerves were raw. He even caught Stillman regarding
him queerly, and that was the last straw.
He felt, somehow, that if he did not confide in some
one he would blow up; so, after supper, he cornered
his classmate in the lobby, and poured the
whole story into his astonished ears.</p>

<p>When Locke had finished, Stillman gave a long
whistle of incredulous astonishment.</p>

<p>“That’s the rottenest thing I ever heard of!”
he exclaimed indignantly. “No wonder you went
to smash that way. But look here, old fellow, are
you certain about the drug part of it? Isn’t it
possible that you had some sort of an attack of
indigestion or something?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>Locke shook his head. “No indigestion would
ever give a fellow feelings like that. Besides, I
was fit as a fiddle before I went into that card
game. Something was put into that beer, Jack;
take my word for it.”</p>

<p>“But who would do such a thing? You say
Elgin you’re sure wasn’t even in the room. Did
you notice anything queer about any other man’s
behavior?”</p>

<p>For an instant Lefty hesitated, the thought of
Fargo’s odd remark, with its odder inflection, in
his mind. The next instant he gave a start as
the big backstop strolled lazily up and paused
beside his chair.</p>

<p>“Sort of off your feed to-day, ain’t you, kid?”
Fargo inquired, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I certainly am,” Lefty answered. He hesitated
a second, and then went on with deliberate
purpose: “I reckon midnight poker games with
all the fixings don’t agree with me.”</p>

<p>“Cut out the fixings and the poker won’t hurt
a baby,” the catcher returned swiftly. “It’s all
right for the regular bunch to make fools of themselves
swilling hard stuff if they want to, but you
kids can’t afford to do that sort of thing. I was
watching you last night and wondering if you
was going to fall for that nonsense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>A flash of sudden comprehension leaped into
Locke’s mind and brought the color swiftly to
his face.</p>

<p>“So that was why you said I’d had enough!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Fargo looked slightly puzzled. “Sure! Why
did you think I said it?”</p>

<p>Lefty’s face was brick-red and his eyes dropped
before the steady, open scrutiny of the catcher.
“I—didn’t realize you were—paying so much attention
to me,” he stammered. “I might have
known, though, when you struck out to-day—to—to
help me out. That was good of you,
Fargo.”</p>

<p>The backstop laughed. “Chase that notion out
of your nut right off, son,” he chuckled. “I ain’t
that crazy—yet. Reckon I must have been a bit
off my feed, too, or else you took a spurt while
I was up to the plate. I s’pose the old man sailed
into you good and proper. He looked dangerous
when I saw him heading your way after the
game.”</p>

<p>Locke explained briefly that the manager had
raked him over the coals in a manner which left
nothing to be desired. “I thought sure he’d end
up by firing me out on the spot,” he confessed in
conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Not him,” grinned Fargo. “He’s too sharp.
You want to toe the mark, though, from now on.
He’ll have them snappy optics of his on you every
minute of the day to see whether this was a fluke
or your regular way of doing things. You’ll have
to show him, that’s all.”</p>

<p>As the backstop strolled off, Lefty’s eyes followed
him for a moment. He had been a fool to
suspect for an instant that this big, rough-and-ready,
but thoroughly straight, dependable fellow
could be mixed up in anything so underhanded.</p>

<p>Stillman, whose trained mind had missed no
point in the conversation, quickly broke the silence.</p>

<p>“You surely didn’t think he had anything to
do with it?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t understand why he said something
he did last night,” Lefty explained. “I was an
idiot, of course.”</p>

<p>“You certainly were. Buck Fargo is one of
the squarest men in the crowd, even if he is a
little rough outside. He’d do anything in the
world for a fellow he likes, and you’re mighty
lucky he’s taken a fancy to you.” He paused for
an instant, his brow furrowed thoughtfully.
“Look here, old fellow,” he went on slowly, “why
don’t you get after the man who served those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
drinks! I’ll bet he knows a thing or two, and
you ought to be able to sweat it out of him.”</p>

<p>Lefty’s eyes brightened. “By Jove!” he exclaimed.
“That’s a good idea, Jack. I shouldn’t
wonder if he did. At least it’ll be worth trying.
He ought to be on duty now.”</p>

<p>Without further delay, he arose and walked
over to the desk. Though he did not know the
fellow’s name, he remembered perfectly what he
looked like, and the clerk recognized his description
at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean George Miller? Why, the proprietor
fired him this morning, Mr. Locke. He
was stewed last night, and had a holdover this
morning. He’s left the hotel, and I don’t know
where you can find him.”</p>

<p>Lefty turned from the desk, with a shrug.
“That’s settled,” he thought disconsolately.
“Why didn’t I think of it before? I suppose I
wasn’t thinking of anything this morning,
though.”</p>

<p>As he walked back to where the newspaper man
sat, he saw Bert Elgin crossing the lobby toward
the door. For an instant he was moved to brace
the fellow then and there and accuse him of playing
that dirty trick the night before. Almost as
quickly, however, he realized how futile that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
would be. Though Elgin was the only man with
a motive strong enough to make him suspected,
Lefty had no shred of proof against him.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” the latter muttered frowningly.
“I haven’t got anything on him—yet. I’ll be
hanged if I don’t think he was at the bottom of it,
though, and if I don’t dig up the truth somehow,
I <em>am</em> a bonehead.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<small>BERT ELGIN’S LUCK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Bert Elgin was decidedly a ladies’ man.
A pretty face in any of the front-rows of
the grandstand never escaped his attention,
and, no matter in what part of the country
his team was playing, he seemed to have an almost
uncanny faculty of scraping an acquaintance
with the best-looking girl in town.</p>

<p>His teammates growled and grumbled enviously,
making sarcastic references to luck and
bluff and working the rah-rah racket to perfection,
but Elgin remained undisturbed by their
comments. There was no questioning the fact
that he could be very charming when he chose to
exert himself. He had a ready tongue, the knack
of subtle flattery, and knew how to utilize the
glamour which most girls throw about a prominent
athlete who has had a college education.</p>

<p>Before he had been three days in Ashland Elgin
maneuvered an introduction to Miss Molly Wendell,
a charming young person with a penchant
for baseball, and obtained permission to call.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Within a fortnight he had availed himself three
times of that permission, and they were on very
friendly terms, indeed.</p>

<p>This evening he arrayed himself with especial
care, and sallied forth about half past seven,
alone, from the hotel. Miss Wendell lived in the
best residential section of town; but, as he made
his way thither, Elgin was not so occupied with
thoughts of the pleasure in store for him as to be
blinded to the feminine charms of any chance
passers-by. That was not his way.</p>

<p>Having bestowed appreciative and very open
glances on several attractive factory girls hurrying
along the main street, the cub pitcher struck
into a quieter thoroughfare which led toward his
destination. He had almost reached High Street
when a rickety, swaying hack, looking as if it
might have seen its best days in some Northern
city a decade ago, passed him and came to a stop
in front of the corner house.</p>

<p>Before the negro driver had time to open the
door the horse—a big, raw-boned animal—took
it into his head to back. Quite undisturbed and
rather amused at the coon’s flow of language,
Elgin watched the ancient vehicle tilt dangerously
until it seemed as if another moment would see
it topple over. Then he came opposite the door,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
glanced curiously into the hack, and the next instant
became transformed.</p>

<p>With a single leap he reached the horse’s head,
gripping the bit with muscular fingers and dragging
the animal forward a step or two.</p>

<p>“Get down here and hold the beast, uncle!” he
ordered. “You’re a nice one to take people out
behind a dangerous animal like this. Hustle,
now!”</p>

<p>The colored man hurriedly descended, muttering
something about “interferin’ w’ite trash,”
and sulkily obeyed. Elgin sprang to the door,
hat in hand, and held it open.</p>

<p>“It’s all right now, sir,” he said deferentially.
“Just take my arm, if you please, and let me help
you out.”</p>

<p>An elderly man, white-haired, frail-looking, and
dressed in a clergyman’s suit of black, obeyed
tremblingly. He was followed much more swiftly
by a young girl, a glimpse of whose lovely face
had been the cause of that sudden transformation
in Bert Elgin.</p>

<p>She barely touched the pitcher’s arm as she
leaped from the cab, the color bright in her cheeks,
a glint of anger in her wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s outrageous bringing us up with a horse
like that!” she exclaimed indignantly. “You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
know I asked particularly if he was gentle, and
you said he was.”</p>

<p>“’Deed he am, leddy,” the negro affirmed hastily.
“Dis hyer am jes’ his playful way. If dat
gemman hadn’t come—”</p>

<p>“If he hadn’t so kindly come to our help,” the
girl put in emphatically, “we should have been
upset.”</p>

<p>As she stepped forward to pay the cabman she
cast a glance of gratitude at Elgin, which started
the blood tingling through his veins.</p>

<p>“What a peach!” he thought fervently.</p>

<p>Nothing of this appeared on the surface, however.
Instinctively he schooled himself to retain
the same respectful, deferential attitude he had
assumed from the first. Still bareheaded, he
seemed to be devoting all of his attention to the
father, who was palpably nervous and upset by the
incident. It was not until she turned from the
negro and came back to them that his eyes met
hers.</p>

<p>“I cannot thank you enough for what you have
done,” she said quickly. “My father is not very
strong, and if the cab had upset it would have
been simply dreadful.”</p>

<p>“It was really nothing,” Elgin protested. “I
saw the horse was a bad-tempered brute, and got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
to his head in time. I’m glad I happened to be
passing.”</p>

<p>“You cannot be more thankful than my daughter
and myself,” the older man put in rather
weakly. “Your quick wit undoubtedly saved us
from a serious accident. Just now I am too tired
after a long journey to express my gratitude
properly, but I hope you will give me the opportunity
at some future time. I am the Reverend
John Harting, and I shall be staying here a week
or more with my friend, Henry Forsythe.”</p>

<p>He held out a slim, white hand, which the ball
player clasped firmly yet not too strenuously.</p>

<p>“My name is Bert Elgin,” the younger man
returned in respectful tones. “I’ll be very glad
indeed to come and see you some evening before
you leave town.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” the clergyman agreed, with impatience.
“Janet, my dear, I think we had better
go in. I am feeling—a little faint.”</p>

<p>Without a word Elgin took one arm solicitously.
The girl sprang to the other side of her father, and
in silence they helped him up the steps of the
veranda. A big, broad-shouldered man of middle
age answered the ring, and, amid the bustle of
greeting which followed, Elgin tactfully departed.</p>

<p>At the gate he paused, glancing back at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
closed door, the remembrance of a pair of wonderful
violet eyes and a perfect mouth curved in
a rather absent smile still vividly in his mind.</p>

<p>“A queen!” he said aloud. “Molly Wendell
can’t touch her for a minute.” Slowly he moved
on a few steps; then he chuckled: “That was a
cute trick, all right, and pulled off to perfection.
I ought to hand that old bag of bones a square feed
for giving me the chance. Will I call to-morrow
night and let the old geezer thank me? Will I?
Ask me!”</p>

<small>THE REASON WHY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Out on the field next morning Lefty Locke
threw himself heart and soul into his
work. He was conscious that Manager
Brennan was watching his efforts with the eyes
of a lynx, and though that made him slightly
nervous at first, it presently came to have the
opposite effect, stimulating him to greater endeavor.</p>

<p>“Kid ain’t doing bad to-day,” drawled Buck
Fargo critically to Jack Stillman, sitting beside
him on the bench. “He certainly was rotten in
the game, though. I wonder what ailed him?
Don’t seem like one glass of beer would knock a
fellow out like that.”</p>

<p>“Depends on what’s in it besides the beer,” the
newspaper man replied impulsively.</p>

<p>The big backstop straightened up and flashed
a keen glance at him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” he demanded
shortly.</p>

<p>Stillman hesitated an instant, his face slightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
flushed, “I suppose I shouldn’t have said anything
about it,” he returned slowly. “Lefty
didn’t want it to get out, but I can’t see any
harm.”</p>

<p>And forthwith he proceeded to enlighten Fargo
concerning the trick which had been put over on
Lefty the night Brennan was in Fort Worth.
When he had finished, the catcher made some
vividly picturesque comments. Then he relapsed
into a thoughtful silence. Finally he turned
curiously to his companion.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble between Elgin and Locke?”
he asked briefly. “Don’t tell me if it’s a secret,
but it sure looks to me as if that was at the bottom
of the whole muss.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t a doubt of it in my mind,” Stillman
answered. “Elgin hates Lefty like poison,
and has every reason in the world to do him dirt.
It happened when we were all at Princeton. Elgin
was pitching on the varsity—pitching mighty
good ball, too. He and Lefty had always been
rivals, but Lefty couldn’t go out that year because
of the back work he had to make up on account of
an attack of typhoid. Just the same, Elgin
seemed to have it in for him, and he never lost
any chance to sneer about him to other men, and
make things generally disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Well, about the middle of the season a chap
named Bob Ferris had his pocketbook, watch, and
a lot of little trinkets stolen. Somebody swiped
’em out of his room while he was at a lecture.
He and Lefty were great friends and were in and
out of each other’s rooms all the time. Ferris
couldn’t find a single clew as to who had taken the
stuff, but a few days later Lefty came in from a
recitation unexpectedly and caught Bert Elgin in
the hall right outside his door. He didn’t say anything
then, but went in and looked the room over.
Nothing seemed out of place except a table
drawer which was a little way open. When he
jerked it out, there were two of the stolen scarfpins
lying right on top of a notebook belonging to
Ferris, which he would probably have come in to
get that very afternoon.”</p>

<p>“The cur!” rasped Fargo. “He put ’em there
a-purpose to throw the blame on Locke.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Lefty followed Elgin to his room,
told him what he’d found out, and started to give
him a nice comfortable thrashing. In the process
of the scrimmage a watch fell out of Elgin’s
pocket. It was Ferris’ watch. Lefty told Ferris
afterward that the sight of it made him
ashamed to be soiling his hands on such a
mucker. He let up right away, told Elgin that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
unless the stolen goods were returned in twenty-four
hours he’d go to the dean and tell him everything,
and got out. Ferris was in New York that
day, but when he got back next morning the stuff
was all on his bureau.”</p>

<p>Fargo stared at him an instant. “Well?”
he queried sharply. “Is that all? Didn’t they
put anybody wise to what the sneak had done?”</p>

<p>Stillman shook his head. “No. He’d have
been fired out of college, and there wasn’t anybody
to take his place on the nine. Lefty and
Ferris talked it all over and decided to keep still
for the sake of the varsity.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted the big backstop. “I’ll be
hanged if I’d have done it!” He paused a
moment, interlacing his strong, brown fingers.
“Well, there ain’t any doubt that’s what started
things going here,” he went on. “Elgin’s sore as
a boil, of course, to have Locke around, knowing
what he does about this stealing. How he worked
this dope trick gets me, though.”</p>

<p>The newspaper man started to explain his
theory of the waiter’s complicity, but in the midst
of it the manager roared out an order to Fargo
to get into the game and limber up some. The
big backstop obeyed and was kept busy for the
rest of the morning. Later on, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
sought Stillman again, to hear the remainder of
the story.</p>

<p>When it had been told he made no comment.
His face showed plainly, however, that his interest
was aroused to an unusual degree; and the reporter
congratulated himself on having secured
a valuable ally for Lefty.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<small>THE PURLOINED LETTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was rather difficult for Lefty to tell what
sort of an impression the day’s work had
made on Jim Brennan. That astute individual
was thoroughly proficient in the art of keeping
his thoughts to himself, and it was almost impossible
for any one to guess what was going on
in his mind. Those who knew him well had long
ago ceased to guess.</p>

<p>He had watched Locke all day as a cat does a
mouse, picking at the least fault, hurling criticisms
in that brusque, snappy way of his at the slightest
opening, and never once giving his cub pitcher a
word of praise. There seemed to be nothing in
this to encourage the southpaw.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lefty knew that he was in good
form. He felt that between his work of to-day
and that disgraceful exhibition of twenty-four
hours ago there was a vast gulf, and he was comforted.
And when, along toward the middle of
the afternoon, he began to notice quite lengthy
periods of silence on the part of his mentor—spaces
of five minutes, or even longer, in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
the manager could find absolutely nothing to carp
at—his spirits began to rise.</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel several of the older
men who had been up before him during the
afternoon paused and made brief, half-joshing
comments on his improvement. Stillman was enthusiastic
in his praise, and even one of his
brother reporters delivered himself of a more
guarded opinion, practically to the same effect.
To be sure, the silence of the other cubs was deep
and absolute. Not one of them opened his head
to Lefty on any subject, much less to tell him that
he was doing well. Evidently the ban against him
was still in force.</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, Locke was feeling
more hopeful, more assured, more satisfied that
he could make good, than at any time since his
arrival at training camp.</p>

<p>“I’ll write Janet to-night,” he thought, while
he was dressing, “and tell her all about it. I
should have done it before, but things have been
pretty uncertain.”</p>

<p>Janet might have been a sister, but—she wasn’t.
Any one observing the length of the letter Lefty
wrote after dinner, and the pains taken with its
composition, would have guessed that instantly.
A fellow rarely sends more than four pages of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
closely written hotel paper to a relative, and as
for tearing up a nearly finished sheet, and rewriting
it—well, that settled the question.</p>

<p>When the epistle had been carefully sealed and
the envelope directed, Locke found he was out
of stamps, and purchased some at the desk. He
had just affixed one to the letter when Buck Fargo
appeared and pounced on him.</p>

<p>“Been looking for you, kid,” the backstop announced,
taking Locke by the arm. “Come out
with me for a little walk. I want to talk to
you.”</p>

<p>Locke acquiesced readily and, without turning,
reached back for the letter he had left lying on
the desk. He was so taken up with wondering
what Fargo had on his mind that his action was
really little more than mechanical. His fingers
closed over an envelope which he thrust into a
side pocket, and the two walked briskly away.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Lefty the proprietor of the
Hatchford was of an economical turn of mind.
Having been considerably fretted by every Tom,
Dick, and Harry in Ashland dropping in and using
his letter paper <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>, he instituted the system
of having a supply at the desk, and nowhere
else. When a guest of the house wanted stationery
he helped himself. A townsman could do the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
same, if he wished. But the mere fact of having
to face the argus-eyed clerk, instead of slipping
quietly to a well-furnished desk, acted as a strong
deterrent.</p>

<p>When Lefty bought his stamps the supply of
envelopes had dwindled to three, two of them
stuck inside the flap of the third. They lay close
beside his letter on the desk, and when he reached
back without looking it was the three empty envelopes,
stuck together as one, that he picked up
and put into his pocket.</p>

<p>His carefully composed epistle lay, face upward,
where he had left it. The clerk was busy with his
books, and no one else happened to see it until
Bert Elgin, as immaculately garbed as he had been
the night before, on his way to the street, paused to
light a cigarette.</p>

<p>The match flared up and he had conveyed it
halfway to the weed between his lips when suddenly
the motion was arrested, and he stared
downward with widening eyes. For an instant
he could scarcely believe his senses. Before him
lay a letter addressed to the very girl whose
charms had so smitten him the night before, and
on whom he expected to call within fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. “Miss Janet
Harting,” written in a strong, masculine hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
stared up at him like a basilisk. Some one in this
very hotel was corresponding with her—some one
who did not know that she had arrived at Ashland
the night before; for the address was a New England
town.</p>

<p>“Kingsbridge!” The word came hissing
through his clenched teeth as he remembered suddenly
that this was the name of the team on which
Lefty Locke had pitched during the past summer.</p>

<p>The forgotten match burned his fingers, and he
flung it to the floor. A second later, however, he
reached over to where a box of them lay, and
struck one, leaning close against the desk as he
did so. When he moved away, the cigarette
alight, his face was still slightly flushed, but his
expression was once more composed. The letter
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Once in the street, he hurried along, scarcely
able to restrain his impatience. Twice he hesitated
by a lighted window, but each time the place
seemed too public for his purpose. At last he
stopped before a little store on a corner, glanced
swiftly and suspiciously around, and drew the
letter from his pocket.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood scowling at the superscription
before he ripped the envelope open.
The frown deepened as he noticed the length of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the inclosure, and then, with narrowed eyes, he
sought the signature.</p>

<p>“Hazelton!” he muttered hoarsely. “I knew
it!”</p>

<p>Rapidly, with now and then a nervous glance
around, his eyes flew over the closely filled pages.
The letter had evidently been written by one very
good friend to another. There was little in it
which any one might not have read, yet its very
tone, with those references to past experiences
together, to mutual friends, to hopes and fears
and interests held in common, sent Bert Elgin off
into a spasm of rage. He had plumed himself
on having, with great dexterity and presence of
mind, obtained the inside track with quite the most
fascinating girl that he had ever seen, only to discover
that the man he hated with every fiber of
his being seemed to have the inside track.</p>

<p>“Confound him!” he cried, crushing the letter
between his fingers, “I can’t seem to get away
from him.”</p>

<p>For a moment he stood there hesitating, his fingers
busy tearing the purloined letter into shreds.
Then he turned the corner, and began to walk hurriedly
toward High Street.</p>

<p>“I’ll beat him yet!” he vowed. “I’ll put him
out of the running here, or I’m a dub!”</p>

<small>GUILE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Really?” exclaimed Janet Harting,
her eyes sparkling. Then she laughed.
“It’s luck you didn’t tell father. He
has an idea that professional ball players aren’t
quite respectable.”</p>

<p>Bert Elgin bent slightly forward, a hurt expression
in the eyes fixed upon her face. During
the fifteen minutes in which he had labored
strenuously to ingratiate himself with her father,
and succeeded beyond his hopes, he had gathered,
by skillful probing, the impression that the older
man was just the sort to look askance on professional
athletics. Not a hint of this now appeared
on the surface, however. His voice was regretful,
with just the proper touch of indignation in it.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t share his prejudice, Miss
Harting?” he said quickly.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” the girl hastened to assure him.
“I adore baseball, and could never understand
why a man shouldn’t take it up just as he would
any other profession. It’s much better paid than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
many, and I’m sure it must be a great deal pleasanter
than being cooped up all day in a stuffy
office.”</p>

<p>Elgin’s sigh of relief was unmistakable. “I
can’t tell you how glad I am to hear you say that,”
he returned, his face clearing. “Your father is
a clergyman of the old school, and I can quite
understand his prejudice. But professional baseball
to-day is very different from what it was in
his time. There isn’t a cleaner, decenter sport
going, or one more free from crookedness. Of
course, there are people who look down on it.
There are even players”—his voice took on a
sneering tone—“who go into it under fictitious
names, but they’re cads and bounders. I notice
they’re not ashamed to draw their salary checks
on the dot. I’ve played ball ever since I left
college, and I can truly say, Miss Harting, that
I’ve never once had reason to regret my choice of
a profession.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. The girl’s
cheeks were faintly flushed and she was plucking
absently at the fringe hanging from the upholstered
chair arm.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you haven’t, Mr. Elgin,” she murmured
presently. There was another momentary
pause before she raised her eyes to his face. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
believe that what you say about a man’s playing
under a false name is generally true, but don’t
you think that once in a while there may be a
perfectly good reason for it?”</p>

<p>The pitcher shrugged his shoulders. “Once in
a thousand times, perhaps,” he admitted. “It’s
easy enough to invent a plausible reason, but I’ve
noticed invariably that fellows do it because
they’re ashamed, not of playing professional ball,
but of having their friends know it. There’s an
instance of this right here in the Hornet squad, a
chap who graduated from Princeton the year after
I did. He tried making his living as a lawyer,
fell down hard, and then took up baseball. There
isn’t an earthly reason why he shouldn’t use his
own name, and yet he’s masquerading as Tom
Locke.”</p>

<p>“Locke!” the girl gasped, staring in startled
amazement. “You don’t mean to say that Phil
Hazelton is <em>here</em>?”</p>

<p>Elgin’s jaw dropped most realistically, and he
drew his breath sharply.</p>

<p>“You—know him?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“Of course I do. Why, he pitched all last summer
for the Kingsbridge team. That’s where I’ve
always lived, you know, until father’s health began
to fail, and he was sent South by one of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
wealthy parishioners. Philip Hazelton is a perfectly
splendid fellow, and we’re great friends.”</p>

<p>Elgin’s face was the picture of confusion. “I—beg
your pardon, Miss Harting,” he stammered.
“I—I had no idea—you knew him, or I should
never have mentioned his name.”</p>

<p>His expression was so contrite that the girl
laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t,” she returned. “How
should you when I haven’t even told you where
I lived? I’ll forgive you, though, for otherwise
I might never have known he was here. I’m sure,
Mr. Elgin, if you knew Phil Hazelton as well as I
do you’d admit that he was the thousandth man
you spoke of a while ago who has a perfectly legitimate
reason for not playing under his own name.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” Elgin returned hastily. “I
don’t doubt that you’re right.”</p>

<p>His voice was quite lacking in conviction, however.
It was the tone of one agreeing out of mere
politeness and because he was anxious to get away
from a disagreeable subject.</p>

<p>Miss Harting, being keen of perception, noticed
this, and her smile faded.</p>

<p>“You don’t really mean that?” she said abruptly.</p>

<p>Elgin spread out his hands depreciatingly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
wish you wouldn’t,” he returned. “A fellow
can’t help having his opinions, you know. Let’s
change the subject.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to change the subject,” she
retorted warmly. “I insist on your telling me
why you don’t agree with me.”</p>

<p>The pitcher’s long lashes drooped over his eyes,
and he bit his lip.</p>

<p>“I knew Hazelton very well at college,” he began
slowly. “We were friends until—certain
things—came up which showed me—” he threw
back his head, and looked her full in the eyes.
“I can’t do it!” he burst out. “Please don’t ask
me, Miss Harting. I’ve said more now than I
should have. No matter what my opinion of him
may be, I won’t talk about a fellow behind his
back.”</p>

<p>His attitude of manly embarrassment was so
well done that the girl was completely deceived.
She was angry at herself for having led the conversation
into this channel, but her estimation of
this man who would say nothing against another
with whom he was evidently not on friendly
terms, increased by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>They chatted on various other topics for a little
while, but the conversation could not fail to be
slightly constrained, and Elgin soon took his leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>After he had gone Janet Harting returned to
the parlor and stood for a space leaning thoughtfully
against the mantel.</p>

<p>“It’s absurd!” she exclaimed aloud presently.
“There’s been some misunderstanding between
them. I won’t believe that Phil is anything but
straightforward and absolutely honorable. He
couldn’t do or think a mean thing. I’ll forget that
I ever heard a whisper against him.”</p>

<p>But this was not quite possible. In spite of
her determination, a nagging little doubt returned
more than once to trouble Janet Harting. Somehow,
she could not forget that Bert Elgin had
known Hazelton at college—known him for years
probably, with chances for seeing phases of his
character which the intimate life at a big university
alone can give; while her own acquaintance
with that selfsame individual was limited to
nine brief months.</p>

<small>THE MAN IN THE CORRIDOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Hang such weather!” grumbled Buck
Fargo, gazing disconsolately out of
the dripping window.</p>

<p>It was not a strictly original remark, considering
the fact that it had been uttered, in some form
or another, on an average of every five minutes
since breakfast time. Nevertheless, it was fervently
echoed by each one of the players who
lounged within hearing distance in the lobby.</p>

<p>It had been pouring all day, a cold, driving
rain, which kept some forty-odd active, vigorous
athletes cooped up in the confines of the hotel.</p>

<p>It was not so bad in the morning, but by the
middle of the afternoon pool had lost its charm,
craps failed to interest; and even the inveterate
poker players were becoming satiated with that
game.</p>

<p>“I can feel myself putting on pounds and
pounds,” mourned “Splinter” Jones, one of the
outfielders, whose winter of luxurious idleness
had resulted in about fifteen pounds of troublesome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
and unnecessary weight. “It’ll set me back
a week.”</p>

<p>“Too bad there ain’t a Turkish bath in this
blooming village,” yawned Cy Russell. “If we
was only in little old New York you could sit in
a steam room and lose all the weight you wanted
to.”</p>

<p>Fargo turned suddenly from the window, his
eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz, Cy!” he exclaimed. “That ain’t a
bad idea. Why can’t we fix up one?”</p>

<p>The pitcher’s eyes widened. “Fix up what?”
he inquired. “A Turkish bath? You talk nutty,
Buck.”</p>

<p>“Nix! It’s a cinch! One thing good about this
hash house is they’ve always got plenty of hot
water. What’s to prevent our hiking up to one
of the bathrooms, stopping the cracks with towels,
and turning on the hot water full. I’ll guarantee
in ten minutes you couldn’t see across the room.
Moreover, the radiators are all red-hot to-day, and
if we wrap Splinter up in blankets and set him
down on one in the bathroom, we’ll see him oozing
away to a shadow before our very eyes.”</p>

<p>Jones straightened up in his chair, his lips
pursed disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“Not me,” he declared firmly. “Mebbe I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
done some fool things in my life, but I never yet
set down on a red-hot radiator without my clothes
on, and I ain’t going to begin now.”</p>

<p>“You loon!” grinned Fargo. “Did you think
I meant without something under you to keep you
from getting scorched? I ain’t got it in for you
that bad. A bunch of bath towels’ll do the trick
and make you so comfortable you’ll be going to
sleep. Come on, boy! Be a sport.”</p>

<p>The others added their persuasions, and at
length the stout outfielder yielded. The thought
of parting with five or six pounds at one fell swoop
was irresistible. He presently arose and, escorted
by eight or ten fellows, made his way to the upper
regions.</p>

<p>Lefty Locke did not happen to be in the lobby
to see them go. He had gone up to his room soon
after dinner, read several chapters in a volume
of Dickens, and taken a sudden notion to write
to his kid brother. By the time the letter was
finished and he had pottered around a little longer,
fretting at the downpour and regretting that he
had not been able to keep up the good work commenced
on the field the day before, it was nearly
half past four.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’ll go down and scare up somebody
for a game of billiards,” he thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>As he opened the door and stepped into the hall,
he saw the figure of a man walking briskly away
down the corridor. For a moment he paid no attention
to the unknown. Presently something
about the set of the fellow’s shoulders struck him
as vaguely familiar, but even then he would probably
have thought nothing of it had not the other
swiftly turned his head, and as swiftly jerked his
face around again.</p>

<p>It was George Miller, the discharged waiter who
had served Locke that fatal glass of doped beer
two nights before.</p>

<p>Without delay, Lefty started to run. The
waiter took to his heels, also, whirled round a
corner toward the servants’ staircase at top speed,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Sprinting after him, Locke reached the corner
just in time to see his man halfway down the long
stretch of carpeted hall. The next instant a wild
yell of pain and rage from somewhere close at
hand broke the stillness with startling abruptness.
A door at Lefty’s right was flung open. Buck
Fargo, his face contorted with mirth, rushed out,
flung himself against the door of the next room,
and slammed it behind him, all in the twinkling of
an eye.</p>

<p>Lefty, bewildered, had no time even to wonder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
what had happened. Close upon the heels of the
flying catcher came a strange figure, clad in blankets
and nothing else, and giving vent to a continuous
bellow of rage. He did not halt or pause.
The whole impact of his big body struck Locke
squarely, and they landed together on the floor
with a crash which seemed to shake the building.</p>

<small>NOT QUITE PROVEN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Blue blazes!” roared Splinter Jones, his
hands clutching Lefty’s windpipe.
“You bonehead! You mutt! I’ll teach
you to pull them towels from under me! I’m
scalded—parboiled—burned to a crisp! Wough!”</p>

<p>Lefty grabbed the other’s wrists and, with a
twist and a wriggle, freed his throat from the
choking grasp.</p>

<p>“Let up!” he panted. “What do you think
you’re doing, Jones? Are you nutty?”</p>

<p>The outfielder gasped and grunted with surprise.
An instant later he had rolled over so that
the cub pitcher’s face was plainly visible, and his
eyes fairly popped out.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” he groaned. “I thought you
was Fargo.”</p>

<p>A roar of delight issued from the open doorway.
As Lefty sprang up, he saw that it was
crowded with members of the Hornet squad,
several of them in next to nature’s garb, and all
convulsed with mirth. Behind them rose vagrant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
eddies of what looked like smoke, but had the hot,
suffocating tang of steam.</p>

<p>“Come and see our Turkish bath, Kid,” invited
Cy Russell when he had recovered his power of
speech. “Buck invented it, but something kind
of went wrong, and he beat it.”</p>

<p>“Went wrong!” snapped Jones, stung afresh
by a sense of his injuries. “The pirate did it on
purpose! Just wait till I get my hands on him.
I’ll make him smart!”</p>

<p>He looked so ridiculous as he stood there, scowling
fiercely and trying to gather the inadequate
folds of the scanty blanket around him, that another
burst of laughter commenced. It was cut
short, however, by the whirring of the elevator.</p>

<p>“Come inside, you loon!” ejaculated Russell,
grabbing the outfielder by the arm and hustling
him into the room. “You ain’t decent. What
if a woman should come along!”</p>

<p>At the suggestion the men all scuttled out of
sight. Lefty followed them. The interruption
had given Miller ample time to make himself
scarce, and, besides, Locke was curious to learn
more of the trick which had been played on Jones.</p>

<p>It proved to be simple to a degree. The improvised
Turkish bath had been an unqualified
success, as Lefty realized the instant he entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
the superheated bathroom, where the atmosphere
made him fairly gasp for breath. The water still
boiled from the tap, sending up clouds of steam.
In one corner was the fateful radiator that had
aided Fargo in the perpetration of the prank which
justly aroused the wrath of Jones.</p>

<p>Until Buck Fargo’s unfortunate propensity for
joking had got the better of him, everything had
gone smoothly. Jones and several other players
who thought they could stand a little less weight
stripped, swathed themselves in blankets, and took
turns sitting on the sizzling radiator, well protected
by several thicknesses of bath toweling.
Perspiration streamed from every pore as superfluous
tissue oozed away.</p>

<p>After each man had indulged in several rounds
of the sweating process, it was observed that
Jones was monopolizing the newly discovered
boon. Protests were unavailing. He simply sat
on the radiator until he could stand the heat no
longer, regardless of the clamorous waiting list,
and Russell was on the point of using force when
he received an unmistakably insignificant wink
from Buck Fargo, which made him refrain from
butting in.</p>

<p>When the outfielder’s turn came again, he carefully
adjusted the blankets about him and approached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
the radiator. The others were all gathered
around, uttering various joshing comments.
The big backstop leaned carelessly against the
wall close to the heated coils. The room was
hazy with steam pouring out of the faucet of the
bathtub.</p>

<p>Cautiously Jones parted the blankets, and let
himself down slowly, quite oblivious to the fact
that Fargo had removed the towels with a dexterous
twitch. The next instant a fearful yell rent
the air, and the outfielder shot up as if galvanized,
caught sight of the catcher slipping out of the
door, and flung himself after in hot pursuit, with
the resultant upsetting of Lefty Locke’s plans.</p>

<p>The latter was not quite so entertained by the
joke as he might have been had it not caused him
to lose the waiter. He was swiftly becoming more
and more convinced that, if he could only once
get hold of the fellow and bring a little pressure
to bear upon him, Miller might tell him a lot.</p>

<p>What was the man doing back in the hotel, anyway?
Lefty wondered as he took the elevator
downstairs. The mere fact of his presence in that
corridor after he had been fired looked suspicious.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame I didn’t come out of my room a
minute sooner,” the cub pitcher grumbled to himself
as he entered the lobby. “I’d have nailed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
him. By Jove, Jack! You’re just the chap I
want to see.” He caught Stillman by the arm,
and propelled him toward a couple of empty chairs
near by. “Who do you think I saw up in our
corridor about fifteen minutes ago?”</p>

<p>“That waiter who was fired yesterday morning,”
the newspaper man returned without an
instant’s hesitation.</p>

<p>Lefty gasped. “What! Did you see him too?”</p>

<p>“No; but I heard him talking to Elgin. Our
rooms adjoin, you know, and there’s a connecting
door which is locked. I was up there, doping out
some stuff to send to the paper, when I began to
hear scraps of talk coming through the door.
Didn’t pay much attention at first, for I wanted
to get my story off in the five-thirty mail, but I
made out that somebody was trying to get money
out of our friend. That made me sit up and take
a little more notice. The chap wanted fifteen dollars
to take him to Dallas. Elgin balked, of
course, and then the waiter said it would be
the last touch he’d make, and, anyhow, it was little
enough, considering all he’d done for Elgin.
They scrapped back and forth for a bit, and then
I reckon Elgin shelled out, for I didn’t hear anything
more.</p>

<p>“The fool part of it was that I never wised up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
to who he was till afterward. I was thinking
about my news dope, I suppose. Anyhow, it
wasn’t till after I’d got that out of the way that I
began to wonder whether the strange guy might
not have been this man we want to get hold of.
It certainly looked a bit like it, his bleeding Elgin
that way.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he say anything about what he’d done
for Elgin?” Lefty asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, or I’d have woke up in a jiffy. It was
only that he’d done something which put him
personally to the bad. I haven’t a doubt now as
to what that something was, but I’m afraid there
isn’t anything you could call real proof.”</p>

<p>Locke shook his head. “I’m afraid not,” he
agreed slowly.</p>

<p>More than ever he regretted that he had missed
the rascal in the corridor by a hair’s breadth.
Truly, luck seemed to be with Bert Elgin in everything
he undertook.</p>

<small>JANET HARTING WONDERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Lefty did not devote much more thought
that night to Bert Elgin and his doings.
Just before supper a letter arrived which
drove every other idea from his head. For a
second or two he stood staring at the familiar
handwriting, wondering how in the world Janet
had found out where he was. When he hastily slit
the envelope and took in the meaning of the few
lines on that single sheet of paper, his astonishment
knew no bounds.</p>

<p>First he gave a long whistle. Then a wide grin
overspread his face. It did not much matter what
had brought the girl to Ashland, the fact remained
that she was here and that he would see
her that night. That was all that really counted.</p>

<p>He ate his supper hurriedly, oblivious for the
first time to the continued coldness of his companions.
His thoughts were elsewhere. Afterward
he hastened up to his room and changed
his clothes. Half an hour later he was running
up the steps of the house on High Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>Janet received him alone, her father having retired
directly after dinner. To Lefty she seemed
prettier than ever, and there was no mistaking
her pleasure in seeing him. After the first greetings
were over, they sat down on the sofa, each
eager to hear all about the other’s doings.</p>

<p>“Father hasn’t been very well all winter,” the
girl explained in answer to Lefty’s first question.
“You remember my writing to you how he kept
catching colds so easily, and couldn’t seem to shake
them off? His rheumatism was worse than it had
ever been before, too, and I was beginning to get
really worried about him when one day, about a
week ago, Cyrus King came in, and told father
he’d arranged for us to go South and stay till
spring. You know that gruff, positive way he
has? Well, he’d planned it all out before he said
a word to us, insisted on paying our expenses,
and wouldn’t even let us thank him. Of course,
he has quantities of money, and he and father are
such old friends I didn’t mind much taking it
from him.”</p>

<p>“It was good of him!” Lefty said warmly.
“But how in the world did you happen to pick on
Ashland to come to? That’s what I don’t quite
understand.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t. At least, that’s not where we’re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
going to settle down. Doctor Lansing knew about
some wonderful mineral springs at Billings,
farther south in the State, and advised us to go
there. We’ve only stopped off here for a week or
ten days to see father’s old friend, Mr. Forsythe.”</p>

<p>Lefty nodded and leaned back, his muscular
fingers linked loosely over one knee.</p>

<p>“I see. But what gets me is how you knew
I was here. You could have knocked me down
with a feather when I got your note. I suppose
you must have seen my name in some paper that
listed me as one of Brennan’s new recruits.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. Her lips were half smiling,
but her eyes were fixed on his face with an
odd sort of intentness.</p>

<p>“No,” she returned quietly. “Mr. Elgin told
me.”</p>

<p>“Elgin?” Locke repeated incredulously. “You
can’t possibly mean Bert Elgin? I know you can’t
mean that man!”</p>

<p>Annoyed by the astonishment and involuntary
disapproval in his voice, she drew herself up the
least bit. If there was one quality on which Janet
Harting prided herself it was her judgment, and
she had never allowed any one save her father to
criticise a person on whom she chose to bestow
her friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?” she retorted. “I like him very
much. Besides, he was the means of saving
father and me from a serious accident.”</p>

<p>She went on briefly to tell how the acquaintance
had come about, and Lefty listened in frowning
silence, gnawing his under lip with firm white
teeth.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just as well that he had been
prevented from giving vent to that first natural
outburst of indignation which leaped up within
him. The discovery that Elgin, of all men, had
made the acquaintance and apparently won the
liking of this girl filled him with intense anger.
The cur wasn’t fit even to speak to her, and in
that moment Lefty detested him as never before.
Only the impossibility of interrupting Janet kept
him from pouring out an impulsive account of
what he knew about the scoundrel, and the even
more contemptible things he suspected.</p>

<p>But, with the passing of that first throb of
anger, Locke felt that this would merely make matters
worse. Certain as he was in his own mind of
Elgin’s complicity in the plot against himself, he
had no real proof, and anything he might say
against the man would seem like the product of
jealousy.</p>

<p>“He came to call last night,” the girl concluded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
“and father was quite charmed with him.” She
hesitated an instant, and then went on slowly:
“I’m afraid you’re not very good friends, are you,
Phil?”</p>

<p>“Oh! You gathered that, did you?” Lefty said
stiffly. “I suppose he blackguarded me to beat
the band.”</p>

<p>“He did nothing of the sort. He never said
a word against you. I simply got the impression
from his manner, and thought it was a pity you
shouldn’t be on better terms.”</p>

<p>“That’s out of the question,” Lefty retorted
shortly. He was perplexed over his inability to
let her know exactly what sort of a man Bert
Elgin was, and that added no little asperity to
his manner. “We could never be friends.”</p>

<p>Janet sighed a little. She was very human, and
where is the girl who is not thrilled by the thought
of reconciling old enemies and healing old sores
by her influence? She did not give up hope of
some day accomplishing it in this case. She only
realized that nothing more could be done at present,
and, womanlike, tucking it away in her mind
for future use, changed the subject abruptly.</p>

<p>“You really didn’t deserve to have me write
you,” she said more lightly, “after the way you’ve
neglected me lately. You must have got my last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
letter over two weeks ago, and I haven’t heard a
word from you since.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Lefty acknowledged. “I ought to
have written, but everything came about so unexpectedly,
Janet, that I put it off till I could have
something definite to tell you. Just because I’m
with a Big League team now doesn’t mean I’ll
stay. I’ve got to make good, and there were two
or three things at first which handicapped me so
that I had very serious doubts of ever doing it.
I did write you a long letter last night, though,
but naturally I sent it to Kingsbridge. You’ll
probably get it in a week or so.”</p>

<p>“Yes; all my mail is forwarded. But of course
you’ll make good, Phil. I don’t see how you can
have any doubt of it. Just look at the wonderful
way you pitched last summer.”</p>

<p>Lefty smiled whimsically. “It’s very nice of
you to think that, Janet,” he said. “But there’s
a lot of difference between last summer and now.
This crowd is one of the fastest in the country,
and I’ll have to be on the jump every minute of the
time to keep up with them. I really do think I
have a show, though, and that’s what made me
write to you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you have,” the girl returned positively.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
“Do you have any games? I’m crazy to
see you pitch.”</p>

<p>“There’s a short practice game every day, but
I don’t know how soon they’ll give me a chance
on the slab. I’ll tell you what: If I find I’m
going to be used, I’ll tell you or send you word,
and you can come out to see the game. If that
doesn’t happen before you leave here, you’d better
come, anyway; for the playing is worth seeing.”</p>

<p>“Good!” returned Janet. “I’d love to come,
and I can bring Jean Forsythe. She’s awfully
nice, and crazy about baseball.” She paused for
an instant, and then went on, more slowly: “I
should think, now that you’re in the Big League,
Phil, you’d play under your own name. You’re
not ashamed to, are you?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, no!” Lefty exclaimed. “What
put that notion into your head? You know how
impossible it was to use my own name last summer,
and, now that I’ve made what reputation
I have under the name of Locke, it wouldn’t be
good policy to change. You should remember
that I have a father, also, who is strongly prejudiced
against baseball, and I see no need of dragging
the name of Hazelton into it. There’s not
much in a name, anyhow. Many fellows take a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
different one, or have one thrust upon them by
the fans.”</p>

<p>There was a note of finality in his voice which
made the girl realize the futility of continuing the
subject. She was wise enough not to try, but after
he had gone she could not help remembering Bert
Elgin’s scornful remark that a professional could
always find plenty of plausible excuses for playing
under a name which was not his own.</p>

<small>THE YELLOW STREAK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Believe me, fellows,” Bill Hagin said
fervently, “that cub, Elgin, is some
scrapper.”</p>

<p>There was a sniff of incredulity from the half
dozen regulars gathered near the plate waiting
their turn. They had heard before of these
pugilistic prodigies, and were inclined to be doubtful.</p>

<p>“I’m from Missouri, Bill,” drawled Russell.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’d been up in my room last night,
you’d been shown good and proper,” Hagin retorted.
“Elgin put it all over One-round Nolan
in the prettiest way you ever saw.”</p>

<p>At this announcement several of the men began
to sit up and take notice; for Ed Nolan, the Hornet’s
crack third baseman, was also renowned for
his skill with the gloves.</p>

<p>“Quit your kidding, Bill,” admonished Red
Pollock. “You can’t tell me no cub put it over
Ed.”</p>

<p>“Truest thing you know,” averred the outfielder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
fervently. “Ask Monte Harris, or Dutch, if you
don’t believe me. We was all talking downstairs
about the match between Kid Baker and Young
Glover in Memphis to-morrow, and Ross—he’s
that punky cub fielder—says he’d back Elgin
against any amateur in his class. Nolan picks
up his ears, and, one word leading to another, we
goes up to my room to call his bluff. Take it from
me, there wasn’t any bluff about the kid, though.
He’s got science and speed to burn, and the dandiest
left hand wallop you ever saw. It sent
Nolan sprawling in the third round as nice as
could be, and Ed ain’t no slouch. I sure wish you
all could have seen it.”</p>

<p>“Why in thunder didn’t you put us wise, then?”
demanded Russell indignantly. “You’re a hot
sketch, pulling off a scrap and letting nobody in.”</p>

<p>A chorus of similar reproaches were hurled at
Hagin from all sides, mingled with eager queries
about Elgin’s other good points, and calls for a
more detailed description of the bout.</p>

<p>Buck Fargo alone sat unmoved and apparently
incurious, a look of incredulity on his face. He
was thinking of that night in the Palace Theater
when Elgin had slipped away, leaving Lefty to
face the wrathy mob alone. He remembered, also,
the story Jack Stillman had told him of the beating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Locke had started to give his college mate
three years before at Princeton, and he smiled a
wide, disbelieving smile as he listened to Hagin’s
vivid description of the cub pitcher’s prowess with
his fists.</p>

<p>But when, later in the day, Monte Harris and
Carl Siegrist backed up the statement, and even
Nolan himself admitted sourly that “the kid
wasn’t so worse,” Fargo grew puzzled.</p>

<p>“Something queer about this,” he thought.
“Looks like I’d have to do a little investigating
on my own hook.”</p>

<p>All morning he was preoccupied and thoughtful,
only arousing himself when Brennan’s eye was
upon him, and even then quite lacking in his usual
joshing repartee. Once or twice he noticed with
a sort of absent approbation that Lefty was showing
some steam and curves in the work-out with
other pitchers; but aside from that he paid little
attention to anything.</p>

<p>During dinner his abstraction continued, but
afterward, on the way back to the field, he might
have been observed suddenly to slap one thigh
with his hand, and mutter something under his
breath. After that he was the old Buck Fargo
again.</p>

<p>The daily practice game now took place in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
afternoon, leaving the morning for batting practice,
throwing, running, and various other exercises.
Ogan, the captain of the cubs, put Redmond,
a fairly promising young twirler, into the
box, but at the end of the second inning withdrew
him, and substituted Bert Elgin.</p>

<p>The latter seemed to be in fine form, and started
off by fanning Cy Russell. The second man up
flied out to center field, and then Fargo came to
the bat. Elgin’s first delivery just missed the outside
corner of the plate. He then put over a
straight, swift one, and Fargo, seemingly “playing
the game,” let it pass. The cub pitcher then
wound himself up for the elusive curve which was
one of his pet specialties.</p>

<p>The ball whirled toward the pan, apparently
heading straight at the batter. Fargo took a
quick step back, then lunged forward. The next
instant he dropped his bat with an exclamation of
anger and pain as the sphere struck his arm with
a dull impact.</p>

<p>His face contorted, the big backstop trotted toward
first, rubbing the injured member, and
shooting at Elgin some extremely vivid and forceful
comments out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>The incident flustered the latter to such an extent
that he whipped a straight one over, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
cut the center of the pan, and it was smashed out
by Siegrist. The next man up sacrificed Fargo
home, but Elgin took a brace; and shut out the
regulars from further scoring.</p>

<p>The game progressed in comparative peace and
harmony for two innings. Then, strangely
enough, Fargo was hit again by the second pitched
ball, and instantly the air was blue. His previous
remarks were as nothing to the words which now
issued from his lips as he glared at the offending
youngster, and they only ceased when Jim Brennan
ordered sharply: “Quit that blackguarding,
and take your base.”</p>

<p>In spite of these two unfortunate happenings,
the cubs nailed the game by a single run; for their
opponents had not yet reached the point where
they were willing to exert themselves overmuch.
That run was scored in the last inning by Elgin,
cleverly assisted by Ogan and Andy Whalen; and
the instant the game was over the players streaked
across the field toward the gate.</p>

<p>Elgin alone lingered behind to get his glove,
which he had tossed over near the bench. Oddly
enough, it was nowhere to be seen. Having been
much too occupied to notice anything outside the
diamond during the past ten minutes, he had failed
to see Fargo scoop up that same useful article<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
when returning from the pursuit of a foul, and toss
it over into the grandstand.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that, while Elgin was searching
vainly for his property, the field was deserted
by all save himself and one other man. The latter
was Fargo, who had started out with the rest,
and then, halfway to the gate, paused, and turned
back.</p>

<p>He was within ten feet of the cub twirler before
the latter glanced up, giving a slight start as
his eyes took in the expression of cold menace on
the big backstop’s face.</p>

<p>“You common mucker!” rasped the latter
fiercely, his big fists clenched as he strode rapidly
forward. “If you think you can put a trick like
that over me a-purpose, you’re a bigger chump
than you look.”</p>

<p>Elgin took a step backward, his face blanching.
“I—didn’t do it on purpose,” he stammered. “It
was—”</p>

<p>“You lie!” snapped Fargo. “Once might have
gone, but not the second time. You’ve got a big
thrashing coming, if I can give it to you. Put up
your fists, you boob!”</p>

<p>His eyes seemed to blaze, and Elgin, after an
involuntary motion to guard himself, dropped his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
arms and retreated a few steps. He was trembling
and his lips quivered.</p>

<p>“I tell you—I didn’t—mean—” he stammered,
and then was silent.</p>

<p>“You’re a liar!” was the retort. “Ain’t you
going to put your fists up, or must I make you?”</p>

<p>There was no reply, and, with a swift forward
motion, Fargo lunged and brought his open palm
against Elgin’s cheek with stinging force. The
youngster staggered back, straightened, and stood
there, head hanging, the picture of terror.</p>

<p>For a moment Fargo stared in silence at the
marks his fingers had left on the now crimson
cheek. Then he burst into a laugh so full of
scorn and contempt that the other winced.</p>

<p>“A quitter!” the big backstop sneered. “A
rotten quitter, that’s what you are! You haven’t
got an ounce of grit in your whole hulking carcass.
I thought there was something queer about your
being such a wonder with your fists. If you had
any nerve you could have knocked me endwise—but
you haven’t. You’re yellow straight through.
I let you hit me with the ball a-purpose, so’s I
could see what you were made of. I’ve found out.
Your glove’s over in the stand, where I fired it.”</p>

<p>Without another word, he turned and strode<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
toward the gate, leaving Elgin standing as if
rooted to the ground. Bert’s face turned from red
to white, from white to deep, purpling crimson.
He gnawed his lips until the blood came, and his
eyes were full of bitter shame at the humiliating
discovery that he had been caught in the backstop’s
trap to test his nerve.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<small>LEFTY’S CHANCE COMES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Al Ogan, the promising cub first baseman
and captain of the Yannigans, was not a
bad fellow at heart. He had been as disgusted
as any of his companions at Locke’s apparently
inexcusable behavior which had lost them
the first game with the regulars, and had joined
heart and soul in the cold ignoring of the southpaw
twirler from that time forth. But at the end
of three or four days, during which he had watched
Lefty’s work closely, he began to wonder whether
he was right or not.</p>

<p>“Maybe he was sick or something that day,”
he thought to himself late one morning, as he stood
watching Lefty pitching to Buck Fargo. “He
hasn’t been the same chap since. He’s certainly
got smoke, and he can put the stuff on the pill
when he tries.”</p>

<p>Presently a bit of friendly joshing between
Locke and Fargo, in which Red Pollock and
another of the regulars joined, made Ogan still
more thoughtful. He kept his eyes open during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the dinner lay-off, and at length he realized that
Locke was on friendly terms with almost the entire
regular crowd, and actually chummy with the
gruff, rough-and-ready backstop.</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged if I know how he’s done it,”
Ogan thought with some slight annoyance.
“They don’t bother much about the rest of us. I
reckon I must have made a mistake. That bunch
would never take up with a quitter.”</p>

<p>That afternoon he took occasion to speak to
Lefty in a careless sort of way which seemed to
indicate he had momentarily forgotten the boycott;
and when Locke answered him without any
signs of pique or soreness, they talked casually
for a moment or two.</p>

<p>At the end of the day Manager Brennan called
Ogan to him.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try an experiment to-morrow
afternoon,” he said shortly. “We’ll lengthen the
game to the full number of innings, and about the
first of the seventh I’ll put Elgin into the box for
the regulars. I want to see what he’ll do with that
kind of support.”</p>

<p>Ogan restrained his surprise, and nodded. “I
suppose I’d better not use him early in the game,
then?” he said.</p>

<p>“No; take some of the others. He’d better be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
fresh when he goes in. The old boys are waking
up and beginning to play ball.”</p>

<p>This Ogan had observed the day before with
some chagrin. Up to that time the cubs had won
every game except that first one, and had come to
have a pretty good opinion of their ability. Yesterday,
however, they had been unaccountably
nosed out in the last inning, while to-day their defeat
had been even worse.</p>

<p>Apparently there was no reason for it. They
were in splendid condition and playing harder
than ever. Their opponents did not seem to be
exerting themselves a bit more than they had done
from the very first. They still contented themselves
with letting a hit go as a single when it
might have been stretched for two sacks. Time
and time again their pitcher let the bases fill, only
to pull out of the hole by some wise old trick—the
product of hard experience—which prevented the
cubs from piling up runs.</p>

<p>Some of the latter did not realize that they were
the victims of inside baseball; that the regulars
were regaining and perfecting the teamwork
which was to count for so much a couple of months
later on. But they would learn it soon, for that
was the principal reason why they were there.</p>

<p>As Ogan turned away from the manager a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
thought flashed into his brain, and he looked
swiftly around. The crowd was streaming toward
the gates, intent on a refreshing bath and supper,
but Ogan’s keen eyes soon singled out Locke in
the rear, and in a couple of minutes he had
sprinted over to him.</p>

<p>“Want to go in to-morrow?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>A faint flush stained Lefty’s face, but his voice
was perfectly composed as he answered readily:</p>

<p>“I sure do!”</p>

<p>“I’ll put you in at the beginning of the seventh.
The old man’s going to lengthen the game, and
wants to run Bert Elgin in to pitch for the regulars.
When he does, you can come out for us.
We’ll talk it over to-morrow.”</p>

<p>That was all he said, but as he walked away
Lefty felt as if he could have hugged the fellow
for giving him this chance. To pitch again for
the cubs was enough in itself, but to be pitted
against Elgin was more than he had hoped for;
and it was with difficulty that he restrained the
exuberant joy which welled up within him.</p>

<p>He could scarcely wait until supper was over,
so eager was he to tell Janet the good news. She
was as pleased as he over it, and they were so busy
planning her coming to the field that she quite
forgot the little hint she had intended dropping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of how glad she would be if he and Elgin would
only make up their differences.</p>

<p>The latter had called again the night before and
conducted himself so tactfully that she found him
even more pleasant than at first. She could not
believe that either he or Lefty could have done
anything very dreadful. It seemed rather as if
there must have been some misunderstanding to
turn them from friends to enemies, and her heart
was set on being the means of bringing them together
again. It was only after Lefty’s departure
that she realized her omission and determined to
rectify it on the morrow if even the slightest opportunity
presented itself.</p>

<small>THERE’S MANY A SLIP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In company with Jean Forsythe, a pretty,
breezy Texas girl, Janet reached the baseball
park the next afternoon about half
past two. They drove down in Jean’s runabout,
and the little car had no sooner come to a stop on
the turf back of first base than Miss Harting forgot
everything but her enthusiasm at the sight
she beheld.</p>

<p>The whole field seemed filled with brown-skinned,
clear-eyed athletes engaged in the usual
practice. A number of them were scattered over
the diamond in their regular positions, while some
one batted to them. At a little distance others
were practicing bunting. Back by the grandstand
an old pitcher was warming up easily.
Farther on a couple of cub twirlers were doing the
same thing, with much more snap and speed. The
crack of wood meeting leather sounded rhythmically,
intermingled with shouts and joshing
laughter. Balls curved gracefully into the sunlight.
The air was soft and balmy, and full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the fragrance of growing things. The sky was a
brilliant, cloudless blue, and it was springtime.</p>

<p>As the girl’s eyes took in the scene, her heart
began to beat a little unevenly; her gloved hands
lay quietly in her lap, the fingers tightly interlaced.</p>

<p>“It’s splendid!” she whispered to herself.</p>

<p>It was deeply interesting to one who could delve
beneath the surface, and see a little of what lay
under that smiling, sunny crust. Here was a veteran
whose name was famous from sea to sea, and
to whom baseball was the very breath of life,
struggling with every fiber of his being against the
inevitable. Perhaps no one else had a suspicion
that he was passing his prime, but some day—and
that soon—his throwing arm would lose its vigor,
or his legs fail to take him down to first in the
marvelous way they had done for years. After
that the toboggan slide; back to the minors for a
while, and then to the scrap heap.</p>

<p>To the seeing mind the field was full of little
tragedies like this, which might seem cruel, but
which were really inevitable. There is no sentiment
in professional baseball. One unvarying
law of the Big League is the survival of the fittest.
As long as a man can fill a position a little better
than any other player the manager can secure—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
that individual is always on the lookout for
new material—he stays on the crest of the wave.
Once let him slip back a very little, however, and
he sinks beneath the surface, never, or at least
rarely, to struggle into sight again.</p>

<p>Happily Janet did not realize all of this, though
perhaps she sensed intuitively a little of the hopes
and fears, the jealousies and heartburnings, which
were inevitable in such a gathering. Presently
she saw Lefty waving to her, and answered him
with a quick smile and nod. A little later, when
the game began, he hastened over to the car, bringing
Buck Fargo with him; for he was anxious that
his friend should meet the two girls.</p>

<p>The big backstop could stay only a moment, but
Lefty remained for several innings, enjoying the
enthusiasm of the girls over the game. Toward
the end of the fourth inning, however, he arose
reluctantly from where he had been sitting on the
step of the car.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to start warming up,” he explained.
“They’re going to put me in with the beginning
of the seventh.”</p>

<p>They both smilingly urged him to win the game
for the cubs, said they would wait for him afterward,
and watched him cross the field with a lithe,
springy step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“He’s fine, isn’t he?” remarked Jean Forsythe
enthusiastically. “I like that Mr. Fargo, too.
Where’s the other one you were telling me about?
I wonder he doesn’t come over.”</p>

<p>Janet had been wondering herself. Quite early
in the game she had picked out Bert Elgin over
by the grandstand pitching to one of the youngsters
who was not playing. It seemed rather odd
that he could not spare a moment to run over and
see them.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s warming up,” she explained carelessly.
“He’s going in with the regulars at the
seventh inning. It’ll be awfully exciting to see
which does the better.”</p>

<p>Lefty talked for a moment or two with Al Ogan,
and then, corralling a fellow to catch for him,
started to limber up his arm. He felt that he had
never been in better form, and the realization
inspired him. So far the game was very close, for
the Yannigans were having a streak of hitting, of
which they took every advantage, so that they
were one run to the good at the end of the fourth
inning.</p>

<p>If Lefty could help them win the game it would
be a triumph, indeed, and would more than atone
for his losing the first time.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifth inning the score remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
unchanged. In the last half of the sixth, however,
the regulars secured the tying run. A little later
Lefty slipped into his sweater, walked to the
bench, and sat down. Elgin had stopped warming
up a moment or two before, and stood near;
but neither paid any attention to the other.</p>

<p>As the inning ended, Lefty saw Jim Brennan
beckon to Ogan and engage him in conversation.
He seemed to be laying down the law in that sharp,
decisive manner of his, and something in the cub
captain’s face sent a momentary thrill of apprehension
through the southpaw.</p>

<p>He thrust it from him, however, and when Ogan
finally turned away from the manager and walked
slowly in, Lefty moved to meet him.</p>

<p>“Old man changed his plans?” the cub pitcher
asked carelessly.</p>

<p>Something, he knew not what, prompted him to
put the question. It never really occurred to him
that Brennan had changed his mind, but afterward
he was more than thankful that the suggestion had
come from him.</p>

<p>“Yes!” snapped Ogan. “He wants Redmond
to go in. I told him I’d promised you, and Redmond’s
arm wasn’t limbered up, but that didn’t
make any difference. Sorry, old fellow, but I’ll
make it up to you another time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>Lefty turned away with a shrug, and tossed his
glove up, catching it deftly as it fell. Then he
laughed. Ogan could have no idea, of course, how
difficult it was to make that laugh sound natural.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Lefty said lightly. “You won’t want
me at all, then?”</p>

<p>“Not this afternoon. I’ll put you in to-morrow,
though, if it takes a leg.”</p>

<p>He passed on toward the bench, leaving Locke
to follow more slowly, his face still indifferent,
but his mind full of bitter disappointment. To-morrow!
That promise was poor consolation
when he had set his heart on pitching to-day. He
would never have another chance like this to pit
himself against Bert Elgin.</p>

<p>The next instant he raised his head and met
Elgin’s eyes fixed upon his face with a look of
malicious satisfaction. For a fraction of a second
Lefty stared. Then he smiled, and, turning,
made his way straight toward the runabout containing
the two girls.</p>

<p>It had suddenly come to him that he would have
to go back and explain to them. He hated the
necessity intensely; but, since it had to be done,
it might as well be gotten over swiftly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<small>THE UNEXPECTED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The remainder of the afternoon was one
long trial for Lefty Locke. He was under
the necessity of keeping up an appearance
of light-hearted indifference before the girls, when
all the time he simply ached to be out there on
the diamond.</p>

<p>He saw Redmond pitching the sort of ball to
delight the veterans, who batted him mercilessly.
He saw Elgin, backed by the whole strength of the
regular team, make a showing such as he had
never made before. He saw the cubs mowed
down, snowed under, beaten to a frazzle; and all
the time he had to laugh and joke and fight down
any signs of the bitter disappointment which filled
his soul.</p>

<p>Janet, knowing him as she did, realized something
of what he must be feeling, and tactfully refrained
from any comments on Elgin’s pitching.
Neither did she tell Lefty how sorry she was at
the way things had gone, and for that he was
thankful. It seemed as if Janet Harting’s pity
would have been the last straw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>When the last inning ended, with a score of nine
to three in favor of the regulars, she further won
his gratitude by suggesting to Jean that they leave
the field at once, before the crowd started, and take
Lefty with them.</p>

<p>He accepted with alacrity. When they put
him down at the hotel, he said good-by to Miss
Forsythe, then held out his hand to Janet.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he said in a quiet voice as she
took it.</p>

<p>The girl smiled understandingly into his eyes.
“Come and see us soon,” was all she said, as the
car moved away.</p>

<p>Of course, the principal topic of conversation
that night was the wonderful exhibition of pitching
shown by Elgin. Some of the newspaper men,
in particular, were more than enthusiastic, hailing
him as the most promising youngster Brennan
had discovered, and predicting a bright future for
him. The older players had seen too many “infant
phenoms” to be in the least impressed; they
knew, moreover, how much of his success had
been due to their own assistance. The cubs were
too downcast over their defeat to think of anything
else. Redmond was wearing a grouch, and
Locke’s stock began to soar when Ogan expressed
a belief at the supper table that if the southpaw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
had been put in, as he desired, the result would
have been quite different.</p>

<p>Lefty missed Jack Stillman and was beginning
to wonder where he was when the reporter suddenly
issued from the elevator, about eight o’clock,
and hurried over.</p>

<p>“Had to get my copy off,” he explained.
“Say! Have you seen old Oggie?”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean Oggie Wilmerding!” Lefty
exclaimed incredulously.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know! The old lobster was
here when we got back from the field this afternoon.
He’s traveling for the Wood’s Hoisting
Engine Company. Talk about class! Oh, hush!”</p>

<p>Lefty grinned. “Oggie always did have a hankering
for lugs,” he chuckled. “But he’s all right,
just the same. Where do you suppose he’s gone?”</p>

<p>“Give it up. He said something about seeing
a man the first thing in the morning, but perhaps
he’s hunting him up to-night.”</p>

<p>This surmise proved to be correct. About half
an hour later a tall, well-groomed, prosperous-looking
chap entered the lobby, and was instantly
seized by the two Princeton men and mauled after
the fashion of college mates who haven’t met each
other in some time.</p>

<p>He was unfeignedly glad to see Lefty, and when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the first exuberant greetings were ended they settled
down in a corner of the lobby to talk over old
times.</p>

<p>“You’re fat as a pig, Oggie,” Lefty remarked,
with fond bluntness. “I’d like to have you on
the squad for about a month.”</p>

<p>Wilmerding waved away the suggestion with
horror. “No, thanks! I never took to exercise.
I’m very well satisfied as I am. Never did like
to see every bone in a fellow’s body.” He paused
an instant, and then chuckled. “But this is the
best ever, running across you three old Princeton
plugs in a bunch. Where’s Elgin? I was
talking to him before supper, and I’ll be hanged if
he isn’t a pretty decent chap. Never cared very
much for him at college, but he seems to have improved
a lot since then.”</p>

<p>The silence which followed his remark was eloquent.
Wilmerding glanced from one frowning
face to the other, and raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he inquired. “Have I
struck a false note?”</p>

<p>“You certainly have if you sized up that cur
as decent,” Stillman retorted impulsively.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” Wilmerding exclaimed.
“Why, he seemed very pleasant. What’s he done
to get you two on his neck?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“What he did at college was enough to get any
self-respecting fellow down on him, let alone the
dirty tricks he’s tried since then.”</p>

<p>The plump chap looked puzzled. “At college?”
he repeated. “I don’t understand, Jack.”</p>

<p>“You will when I tell you that he was the one
who stole Bob Ferris’ watch and money, and then
tried to put the blame on Lefty.”</p>

<p>The effect of his words on Wilmerding was extraordinary.
The healthy glow faded swiftly
from the plump cheeks, leaving them pale and
mottled. His jaw dropped, and for an instant he
sat staring at the reporter with startled eyes.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” he gasped at last, in a hoarse,
trembling voice.</p>

<p>“It’s not impossible,” Stillman retorted
sharply. “The whole thing’s as plain as print.
Lefty caught him with the goods.”</p>

<p>Slowly Wilmerding turned his eyes on Locke.
The look in them was that of one who is unable to
credit the evidence of his senses.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” Locke affirmed, wondering curiously
what brought that extraordinary expression into
the other’s face. “I saw the watch in his possession.”</p>

<p>Wilmerding dropped his lids and swallowed
hard. For a moment or two he sat staring at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
lap, where his plump, well-cared-for hands lay,
the fingers tightly interlaced. His mouth was
twitching nervously and his face was still pale.
At last he raised his head again and glanced at
Stillman.</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible, Jack,” he said unevenly.
“You’ve made a big mistake.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Oggie,” the reporter snapped.
“There isn’t a chance of that. What the deuce
do you know about it, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Wilmerding moistened his dry lips. “A great
deal,” he said slowly. “I—was the—thief, myself.”</p>

<p>“You?” exclaimed both men together.</p>

<p>Then Locke laughed oddly. “Jove! That was
well done, Oggie,” he exclaimed. “We both bit
beautifully.”</p>

<p>Wilmerding shook his head. His eyes were tortured.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” he said, more clearly. “I’m
not fooling; I mean every word I say.” He
reached out, and gripped the edge of a small table
standing beside his chair; somehow, the action
seemed to steady him. “It’s mighty hard to tell
you fellows,” he went on slowly. “I thought the
whole wretched business had been buried forever.
I never expected to hear of it again, but I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
let you go on thinking what you do about Elgin.
As true as I sit here, I stole those things from
Ferris. I didn’t mean to do it, but I took them
just the same. Ever since I was a kid I’ve been
cursed with a sleepwalking habit, and not the ordinary
sort, either. When I’m asleep I do things
I’d never dream of doing in my right senses. You
remember Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?”</p>

<p>Lefty nodded silently. He was too amazed to
speak.</p>

<p>“Well, in a way I’m a Jekyll and Hyde. I’ve
often thought that, sleeping and waking, I have
two just such different personalities as those.
I’ll never forget the awful sensation of finding out
the first time that I’d been into somebody else’s
room and stolen a scarfpin off the bureau. It was
at a summer hotel, and I managed to put it back
without any one finding out. At college I did the
same thing every now and then, but never very
much, and always managed to get my loot back
undiscovered. I thought I’d done the same thing
with Ferris’ belongings.”</p>

<p>“But, Oggie, this is all rot!” Lefty burst out.
“You’re worrying yourself over something which
is utterly impossible. I tell you I saw Ferris’
watch fall out of Bert Elgin’s pocket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“Could you swear to the watch?” Wilmerding
asked wearily and without conviction.</p>

<p>“Well, it looked exactly like it.”</p>

<p>“Must have been some other watch,” Wilmerding
returned positively. “Did he ever confess
to you that he did the stealing?”</p>

<p>“N-o, I can’t say that. In fact, he denied it up
and down; but of course he’d do that. I told him
unless the things were returned in twenty-four
hours I’d go to the dean. They were back on
Ferris’ bureau the next morning.”</p>

<p>Wilmerding nodded. “Naturally, when I put
them there myself. In my sleep I had hidden
them behind some books on a shelf, and I didn’t
find them until that night. I tell you fellows,
you’ve made a terrible mistake. I never cared
much for Elgin in the old days, and had very little
to do with him, but I can’t keep still and let any
man suffer for my own wrongdoing.”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the deadly earnestness
of his tone, and, as he realized what the disclosure
meant, Lefty experienced an odd, sinking sensation.
Thoroughly upright and straightforward
himself, the thought that he had been the means
of branding an innocent man as a thief was intolerable
to him. Moreover, if Elgin was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
guilty of that theft, what proof had they of his
complicity in recent underhanded doings?</p>

<p>With a feeling that the earth was dropping away
under his feet, Locke turned toward Stillman.
He saw on the reporter’s face that same expression
of groping blankness which he knew was on
his own.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<small>THE STRUGGLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Lefty went to his room rather early that
night, but not to bed. The discovery of
the terrible mistake he had made regarding
Elgin bewildered him at first, and then made
him feel as if he wanted to get away by himself
to think it all over.</p>

<p>For three years he had felt absolutely certain
of Bert Elgin’s responsibility for that theft at
Princeton. He had felt the scorn and contempt
for his college mate which any decent man would
naturally feel for a person guilty of what Elgin
had done. He had, moreover, from the very first,
never hesitated to show those feelings. Now it
would seem that he had been totally in the wrong.</p>

<p>It was a most disagreeable discovery. Lefty
would have felt glad indeed had there been a
chance of believing Wilmerding mistaken, but
such a thing was hardly possible. Oggie had
never been on friendly terms with Elgin in the
old days, so there was no earthly reason to suspect
him of making up the story in order to shield
the real culprit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“And, anyway, he couldn’t have told it the way
he did unless it were true,” Locke thought to himself.
“It isn’t in him to fake a thing so realistically.”</p>

<p>Frowning, Lefty moved restlessly about the
room, picking up an article here and there and
replacing it without a realization of what he was
doing. Of course the only proper course for him
to follow was to go straight to Elgin and apologize
for having misjudged him so greatly, but the
thought of doing so was intolerable.</p>

<p>He detested the fellow as much as ever. His
suspicion of Elgin’s responsibility for the doped
beer remained unshaken. Whether the man had
stolen or not, did not affect that question.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it!” Lefty burst out, at length, a
vivid picture of the sneering reception which
would greet an apology on his part flashing into
his mind. “I detest that man, and I won’t give
him a chance to crow over me. He’d seize it gleefully.”</p>

<p>For a time he deluded himself with the idea
that, after all, it wasn’t up to him to do anything.
The matter had never been made public. With
the exception of Ogden Wilmerding, Stillman and
Ferris were the only ones who knew anything of
it. It had long ago been relegated to the past.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Why should it be dragged out into the light at this
late day? He would write to Bob Ferris that very
night and put him straight about the matter.
That should be enough.</p>

<p>Deep down in his heart Lefty Locke knew that
it was not enough. Because he was clean and
straight and honorable, he knew that it was up to
him to apologize to the man he had so cruelly misjudged,
whether he detested him or not. He had
been responsible for the stigma resting on Elgin’s
good name, and that responsibility could not be
shirked. Common decency made it imperative for
him to acknowledge his mistake.</p>

<p>The decision was not an easy one. In fact,
Lefty had never struggled harder against the
temptation to take the simple course and let things
slide. If he kept silent, the chances were a thousand
to one that Elgin would never hear a whisper
of Wilmerding’s story. The latter was not likely
to repeat it to others, and Stillman would certainly
keep the matter to himself.</p>

<p>In spite of all these plausible arguments, however,
the southpaw knew that there was really only
one thing for him to do, much as he hated it; and,
having come to that conclusion, he lost no time
in ridding himself of the unpleasant duty.</p>

<p>A glance at his watch told him that it was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
yet eleven. Possibly Elgin might still be up, and
if the task could be done that night, so much the
better.</p>

<p>Stepping out into the corridor, he walked to
Elgin’s room, noticed the light streaming through
the transom, and, without further delay, knocked
firmly on the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” called a voice impatiently.</p>

<p>Elgin, partly undressed, stood in the middle of
the room. As his rival entered and closed the
door behind him, a look of surprise flashed into his
face, followed swiftly by a scowl.</p>

<p>“Well, what in blazes do <em>you</em> want?” he snapped
with pointed emphasis.</p>

<p>Lefty bit his lips to keep back the retort he
longed to utter. He realized that it was going to
be even harder than he had expected.</p>

<p>“I’ve found out that I was wrong about that
affair at college, Elgin,” he said stiffly. “I came
to tell you that I am sorry for having misjudged
you.”</p>

<p>For an instant Elgin stared at him in silence,
the shirt he had just taken off trailing unheeded
on the floor. His face was an odd mixture of astonishment
and suspicious incredulity.</p>

<p>“You mean—about the Ferris—business?” he
asked jerkily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>Locke nodded. “Yes; I was mistaken in thinking
you mixed up in it. I’ve been mistaken for
three years.”</p>

<p>Elgin’s brows came together in a scowl. His
lids drooped until they quite hid the expression
in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he grunted. “And when did you
find out what an ass you’ve been making of yourself?”</p>

<p>Lefty flushed, and set his jaws. “I learned the
truth to-night,” he admitted.</p>

<p>Suddenly Elgin’s face relaxed from its rather
tense, searching expression, and he laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>“And so you’re sorry?” he sneered. “That
puts you right, I suppose! Without a shred of
evidence, you accuse a man of stealing. For three
years you blackguard him every chance you get,
and then, when you find out the truth, when you
wake up to the fact that you’ve been all kinds of
a blackguard, all you can do is to come around
whining about being sorry. Bah!”</p>

<p>Lefty drew his breath sharply, his self-control
strained almost to the breaking point.</p>

<p>“What more can I do?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Elgin’s lips curled. “Oh, nothing—nothing,”
he sneered. “It’s what you should have done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
before that gets me. Anybody but a fool would
have waited till he could prove it before he called
a man a thief. But no; you had to jump in and
show how smart you were without giving a thought
to the damage you might be doing to a person’s
character.”</p>

<p>Lefty felt that argument would be futile. Besides,
he knew that if he stayed any longer he
would most certainly blow up and say something
he might afterward regret.</p>

<p>“I’ve told you I’m sorry, and I am,” he repeated
briefly. “I’ll write to Bob Ferris to-night,
and put him straight about the matter. I
fail to see what more there is to do.”</p>

<p>Without further words, he turned abruptly to
leave the room. He had almost reached the door
when Elgin’s sneering voice broke the silence:</p>

<p>“If you think this squares everything between
us, you’ve got another guess coming. I haven’t
forgotten how you’ve slandered me, and I never
will, even if you should crawl like this every day
for the rest of the year.”</p>

<p>Lefty whirled, his eyes blazing. “I don’t give
a rip what you remember or forget!” he retorted
sharply. “I apologized because I had to save my
self-respect. If you imagine I want to have anything
more to do with you than before, get rid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the notion right away. I don’t like you or your
methods. You may not be guilty of stealing, but
there are some other things fully as rotten that
you have done.”</p>

<p>Before Elgin could reply the southpaw had
jerked the door open, stepped swiftly through,
and slammed it behind him.</p>

<small>GAINING GROUND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“What the deuce did you go and tell
him for?” Jack Stillman demanded
pettishly.</p>

<p>“Because I had to,” retorted Lefty, with some
asperity. He was tired of the whole subject, and
desired to forget it. “Don’t be a fool, Jack.
There wasn’t anything else to do.”</p>

<p>The reporter shrugged his shoulders. There
was a note of finality in his friend’s voice which
he knew better than to disregard.</p>

<p>“Well, all I can say is I’m thankful my conscience
isn’t so blamed sensitive,” he sighed.
“He’ll be so swelled up there won’t be any enduring
him. Heaven knows he’ll be chesty enough,
as it is, when he sees the papers.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Jack?” Lefty asked curiously.</p>

<p>The reporter scowled. “Same old dope about
‘Marvelous Cub Twirler Discovered by Astute
Manager,’” he explained sardonically. Stillman
had a trick of talking in capitals which made one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
fairly see the glaring headlines. “It’s the same
every spring, only this year there are a lot more
kids around than usual who can handle a murder
case or robbery a heap better than they can a Big
League training season.”</p>

<p>Lefty grinned. “Oh, you mean they’re giving
him a puff on account of yesterday?”</p>

<p>“A puff isn’t quite the word. I wish you could
have seen some of the rot Temple, of the <cite>Blade</cite>,
doped out. He wanted my opinion on it; said he
was a bit new to this, you know. I smoothed down
the story a little, but I’m dead sure a lot more
will rant as bad, or worse. Most of ’em seem to
think because the regulars had a landslide it was
due to Elgin’s pitching. They don’t figure out
that Redmond’s bum work had anything to do
with it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the odds?” Lefty laughed. “You did
the same thing last year, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not quite. I knew something about baseball
to start with, and Johnny Hargreaves tipped me
off to a whole lot more.”</p>

<p>“Still, Elgin really did do pretty well,” Locke
remarked slowly. “Anybody must concede that
much.”</p>

<p>“No better than he has half a dozen times before,”
the reporter retorted. “That’s all I said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
in my story, but when I found the way the rest
were piling it on, I had to stick in another paragraph.
Otherwise I’d be getting a wire from the
chief to wake up and take notice.”</p>

<p>“After all, I don’t believe it amounts to a terrible
lot,” Lefty said carelessly. “You can’t fool
Brennan, and his opinion is really the only one
that counts.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as he joined the squad a little
later for the morning jog out to the grounds,
Lefty could not help feeling a twinge of regretful
envy. If he had only been allowed to go on the
slab for the cubs the day before, he had a notion
that Elgin’s performance would not have seemed
quite so brilliant. Those laudatory newspaper
notices might have had someone else as the object
of their praise, and, though he knew how little
such plaudits really counted, Lefty was a very
human sort of fellow, after all.</p>

<p>According to his promise, Al Ogan put the
southpaw in the box that afternoon, and Locke
pitched for six innings to such purpose that the
game resulted in a tie in spite of the fact that
the regulars were in as good a form as ever, and
seemed to work a little harder than usual.</p>

<p>From that time on, Locke’s companions began
to thaw. Once they realized that Lefty’s first disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
exhibition had not been a sample of his
usual form, they endeavored to make up for past
unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Perhaps their new friendliness was hastened by
the newspaper prominence of Bert Elgin. Few
men can view unmoved the sudden elevation to
fame of a comrade, especially when they feel that
this elevation has not been especially merited.
Newspapers began to drift in from all the big
cities, in which Elgin was heralded as “Brennan’s
New Find,” “A Second Matty,” “By Far the
Most Promising Recruit of the Season,” and so
on.</p>

<p>Then followed pictures of the new pitcher in
every variety of pose; his style was dissected and
analyzed; his progress was noted; for, having
launched this boom, the reporters felt under the
necessity of pushing it along.</p>

<p>All of these things were not calculated to
soothe the spirits of the other cubs, whose existence
was noted by scant sentences scattered thinly
throughout the sporting columns. They looked
askance on Elgin, and the latter, not bearing up
well under prosperity, gave them plenty to criticize.
He developed an irritatingly jaunty air,
which was flaunted at all times. He grew very
familiar with most of the newspaper men, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
when on the slab gave decided evidence of mannerisms,
which tried the patience and aroused the
ire of his fellow players.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, his ability to pitch increased
rather than lessened, so that their sarcastic
utterances rather lost point. A man can make
all sorts of a fool of himself off the slab, he may
even go through ridiculous posings and posturings
while winding up, but when his work is as uniformly
good as Bert Elgin’s was, criticism is
usually superfluous.</p>

<p>The days passed swiftly, with the most of the
squad showing an increase in efficiency. They
were hitting better, running faster, and throwing
more accurately. The regulars were rapidly perfecting
their teamwork, and the cubs beginning to
learn the importance of something more than the
rudiments of “inside” baseball. Some of them
took to it like ducks to water, and absorbed intricate
secret signals and caught on to the theory
of certain movements as if they had been brought
up on nothing else from their cradles. These
were the men who would push forward to the front
ranks. The slower-brained recruits were doomed.</p>

<p>Lefty Locke enjoyed that week more than any
similar space of time he could remember. Baseball
as a science had always interested him tremendously.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
He had spent a great deal of time
studying out different plays and the reasons for
them, but up to now these mental exercises had
been generally limited to the more obvious sort,
though he did not realize that at the time.</p>

<p>He knew it, however, the moment the Hornets
began to pick up and show what they could do
when they were in trim; and, though the discovery
was something of a blow to his self-esteem, it only
goaded him to constant effort and increased mental
agility to keep up the pace.</p>

<p>Therefore his work steadily improved. While,
perhaps, not so spectacular and dashing as Bert
Elgin’s, it showed evidence of thought and clear
judgment; and very soon it became apparent that
he was crowding his rival close, if not actually surpassing
him in general ability and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>The one drawback to an otherwise pleasant
period was Janet Harting’s behavior. She and
Lefty had come perilously close to their first quarrel,
and all because of his absolute refusal, not
alone to make up his differences with Bert Elgin,
but to tell her of what those differences consisted.</p>

<p>After her first coolness she had been very nice
about it, but somehow Lefty had a feeling that she
was not quite the same. She was pleasant and
cordial, and went twice to the baseball park to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
see him pitch before she and her father left Ashland
for the mineral springs at Billings. In spite
of all that, however, Lefty sensed the faint rift in
their friendship, and it troubled him.</p>

<p>Instinctively he laid it to Elgin, whom he knew
visited Miss Harting almost as frequently as he
did, and he despised the man more than ever for
it. It was one of those cases, however, in which
a person can do nothing. Locke simply had to
sit still and let events take their course. He worried
and fussed a bit at first, but presently his
whole mind became so engrossed in the struggle
to make good and win out that he ceased to be
actively troubled over something which he could
not remedy.</p>

<p>After all, if he could only manage to outpitch
Elgin on the diamond and prove himself the better
player, there was more than a chance of his showing,
at the same time, the girl he cared for that he
was the better man.</p>

<small>A CHANCE TO MAKE GOOD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jack Stillman lolled in the big cushioned
chair, his eyes fixed on the backs of two
men, carrying suitcases, who were just
leaving the hotel in company with half a dozen of
their fellow players.</p>

<p>“Back to the hay fields for yours,” he murmured
sardonically. “Another couple of years,
and you may be ready for fast company. This
is the beginning of the exodus, Lefty.”</p>

<p>For an instant Locke’s face was rather serious.
Then he smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“You’re a stony-hearted ruffian, Jack,” he said.
“I feel sorry for them. After working hard and
getting your hopes away up, it’s a beastly disappointment
to be told you haven’t made good. I
suppose you’ll think it’s a joke when I pack my
little bag and go forth into the cold world.”</p>

<p>“I’d laugh myself sick,” chuckled the newspaper
man. “At present, however, I don’t see
any chance of that coming about. At the risk of
giving you a swelled head, I’ll tell you, old chap,
that you’re liable to stick around.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“This from the oracle!” laughed the southpaw.
“I’m overwhelmed. But seriously, Jack, if I have
improved a little, so has Bert Elgin. Of course,
I’d never admit it to any one else, but it’s my
private opinion that he’s the better pitcher.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you,” Stillman returned
decidedly. “There’s no denying that Elgin’s
good. He’s got speed and fine curves and very
fair control, but the combination of all three
doesn’t always make a first-class pitcher. He’s
got to pitch with his brain as well as his arm, and
he’s got to have plenty of nerve, both of which
qualities I’ve noticed in you. I’m curious to see
what Elgin will do when he’s up against a real
team.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope the old man agrees with you,”
Lefty returned. “It looks to me as if it would be
a fight between us two as to which will be kept and
which farmed out.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t he keep you both?” the newspaper
man inquired.</p>

<p>“Look at the corking bunch of regulars he has
already,” Locke protested.</p>

<p>Stillman laughed. “Haven’t you got wise yet
to the fact that a team can’t have too many good
twirlers? A Big League season is a whole lot
different from the ball you played last summer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
It begins in April, and doesn’t end till October.
It’s fight, fight, fight, week after week, month after
month, with the knowledge that a single game, a
single inning, sometimes even a single play, may
start a slump. It’s hard, grilling work, and
Brennan knows well that any minute one of his
star twirlers may be down and out. He’s not running
any chances, and you take my word for it
that, if you and Elgin don’t fall down, he’ll keep
you both.”</p>

<p>“You’re a real comfort, Jack,” Lefty said.
“I’ll try not to slump. Wish I knew who was
going on to the slab first to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” the reporter asked, with sudden
interest. “I thought he picked the team this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“So he did, all but the battery. Perhaps we’ll
hear before bedtime. I’d sure like to go in. This
will be rather different from the usual practice
game.”</p>

<p>Stillman nodded emphatically. “You bet your
boots! The first game with an outside team is
usually an eye-opener. You fellows think you’re
pretty hot stuff because you’ve trimmed the regulars
a few times, forgetting that the old men take
things so easy during training season that you’d
hardly know they were working at all. Cy Russell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
lets you hit him a dozen times in a game; so does
old Pop. I’ve seen you fan Dutch Siegrist twice
running. Do you s’pose you could do that a month
from now? Forget it! This game to-morrow is
going to be a jolt for some lads, if what I hear
about that wild Texas bunch is right. I wonder
the old man would consent to a match so early.
They usually aren’t pulled off till just before we
start north.”</p>

<p>“Buck told me their manager had sent in a
challenge, and the chief didn’t feel like turning it
down,” Lefty remarked. “I s’pose he didn’t
want to give ’em a chance to crow.”</p>

<p>“Very likely. Well, it’ll be some fun, anyhow.
I understand their pitcher has a reputation for
rough-and-ready baseball. I’ll be hanged, old
man, if I wouldn’t be just as well pleased to see
Elgin up against that sort of thing if I were you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a chance,” Lefty laughed. “I’ve
been up against some tough characters before, and
perhaps even this Texas steer can’t put much
over me.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” chuckled Stillman.
“The old man’s heading this way with Ogan, and
from the expression on his face I should say you’d
been chosen for the goat.”</p>

<p>His surmise proved to be correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“You’ll start the game to-morrow, Locke,” the
manager said abruptly, as he halted by Lefty’s
chair. “I’m told this Schaeffer is a roughneck,
so look out for squalls. No matter what he does,
don’t let him badger you into anything. I’ll see
to it that he’s kept within bounds, but them kind
of ball players is so full of tricks you can’t catch
’em all. You and Ogan and Fargo better get together
to-night and fix up your signals.”</p>

<p>After Lefty and the cub captain had departed to
hunt up their backstop, Jim Brennan stood for a
moment looking at Stillman out of the corner of
his eye. The latter was one of the few reporters
with the squad that year who knew baseball from
the ground up, and the stories he sent home to his
paper usually had the manager’s entire approval.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem much fretted about putting
your cubs up against this young sagebrush fellow,”
the newspaper man remarked presently.</p>

<p>Brennan’s eyes twinkled a bit.</p>

<p>“I ain’t,” he admitted. “Likely they’ll get the
pants licked off ’em, but that’ll do ’em good.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>
<small>A BAD BEGINNING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">As the Broncs spread out on the field for
preliminary practice, their opponents
looked them over with undisguised interest.
They saw nine husky, sunbrowned fellows,
quick, lithe, and snappy in their movements, who
scooped up grounders, smothered flies, and lined
the ball from one to another without any bungling,
hesitation or wooden headwork. They had been
playing all winter in the Southern States, and certainly
showed the fact in their efficiency and teamwork.
They were not really Texans, although
posing as such, but, instead, players gathered from
various parts of the country.</p>

<p>“Looks like a pretty swift crowd,” Al Ogan remarked
to Lefty. “If any one should ask me, I’d
say we had our work cut out for us.”</p>

<p>Locke smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“I reckon we can handle them,” he returned.
“With Fargo and Pollock in the infield and Hagin
at center, I’m not worrying. Each one of those
men hit over three hundred last season.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>“Exactly,” the cub captain said significantly,
“but that was last season. Their averages have
been pretty punk this spring. I’m not so sure
that the team is strengthened a whole lot by running
them in at the last minute.”</p>

<p>“Personally, I’m mighty glad to have Fargo
behind the pan,” said Lefty. “Whalen isn’t bad,
but there’s not another backstop in the country
who can teach Buck anything. Well, there goes
the umpire. It’s up to us to show these bucking
broncs that they’re not the whole shooting
match.”</p>

<p>Though he spoke confidently, Lefty did not feel
quite as nonchalant and undisturbed as he pretended
to be.</p>

<p>The Hornets had the field, and it was up to their
pitcher to keep the heavy hitters, who would almost
certainly head their opponents’ batting list,
from doing too much damage before he had discovered
the strength and weakness of each man,
and could govern himself accordingly.</p>

<p>Lefty knew that Fargo would help him out to
the best of his ability, but even the experienced
backstop could not be counted on to gauge accurately
the batting capabilities of men he had never
set eyes on before. There was nothing to do but
proceed cautiously, sounding the batters as best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
he could and relying on his support to take care of
the hits.</p>

<p>The first man up was “Cinch” Brown, one of
the Texan outfielders, a tall, rangy fellow with a
hawklike nose and a pair of keen, dark eyes which
seemed to miss nothing. For a second the southpaw
hesitated, trying to fathom just what sort of a
ball would be “meat” to this Southerner.</p>

<p>Something—intuition, perhaps—gave Lefty the
notion that a low, straight one, close to the knees,
would be less palatable than any other, and his
judgment was strengthened when Fargo crouched
behind the pan and made a signal beneath his huge
mitt.</p>

<p>Without delay, the southpaw put it over,
straight, swift, and cutting the near corner just
above the batter’s knees—and Brown lashed it out
as if he preferred that kind of a ball to any other.</p>

<p>But for the fast fielding of Bill Hagin, the hit
would have been good for two cushions. The Big
League man, however, got after the ball in splendid
style, and made a running, one-handed stop,
which prevented the sphere from getting away
into the remote distance of center field.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Cinch!” came in a harsh
voice from a little to the left of the plate. “That’s
the way to start her off. This kid’s easy fruit.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
We’ll have him going. Smash it out, Bull; you
can do it.”</p>

<p>There was an odd, unpleasant quality to the
voice which made Lefty dislike it intuitively. He
cast a swift, curious glance in that direction, and
saw, as he had surmised, that it came from the
notorious Zack Schaeffer. The Texan twirler
stood with his hands on his hips, his powerful
legs spread wide apart. When his eyes met
Lefty’s, a slight sneer curved his full red lips,
and, with an unpleasant laugh, he turned to say
something to the man near him.</p>

<p>That sort of thing did not bother the southpaw
in the least. With an inward determination to
settle Schaeffer’s hash if he possibly could when
the latter came to the bat, he turned his attention
to Bull Kenny, the backstop of the Broncs.</p>

<p>The latter looked dangerous as he squared himself
at the plate, poising his bat over his shoulder.
He was a big, square-jawed, heavily built fellow,
and wielded a massive club. Ordinarily Locke
would have looked for a bunt, but it was evident
from the way he held himself that Kenny had no
intention of sacrificing.</p>

<p>He quite ignored a coaxer which Lefty tried
him with, and the latter, taking a signal from
Fargo, sent over a whistling high inshoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>Kenny smashed it full and fair, driving it out
on a line over the head of Sandy Rollins at second.
Then he dug his spikes into the ground, and went
flying down the line to first at a speed which
showed that hitting was not his only accomplishment.</p>

<p>As before, it was Hagin who raced forward,
scooped up the ball on the run, and lined it to
second. Brown had taken a fair lead, however,
and made the second sack by a hair’s breadth,
amid a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“Got ’em going, boys!” yelled Schaeffer.
“They’re e-easy. Now, Pete, you know what to
do.”</p>

<p>Nevens, third baseman, evidently did. He was
prepared to sacrifice, but Locke kept the ball high
so that it was difficult for him to bunt effectively.
He was finally forced to hit, and hit he
did, though not safely. Nevertheless, he pounded
the ball into the diamond, and the two runners advanced,
while he was thrown out at first.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff,” laughed Schaeffer, as he
stepped out with his bat. “Here’s where we pull
the Hornet’s stinger.”</p>

<p>He had a peculiar swaggering gait, and carried
himself in a manner which showed how thoroughly
he appreciated his own ability. Lefty felt an intense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
desire to fan the fellow, who seemed so
cocksure of himself. He was glancing at Fargo,
ready to take the signal, when he saw that Schaeffer
had crowded up to the plate, his toes well over
the box line.</p>

<p>“Get back,” Locke said sharply.</p>

<p>“Aw, pitch the ball!” snapped Schaeffer.
“What’s bitin’ you?”</p>

<p>“You’re out of your box,” declared Lefty.
“I’m liable to hit you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a chance, Willie,” the Texan retorted
offensively. “I ain’t seen you pass up anything
very dangerous so far.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at the umpire’s command, he
edged back grudgingly, but persisted in keeping a
bit of his toes over the line.</p>

<p>“The close ones for him,” Lefty decided
swiftly. “With that reach of his, he can hit anything
a foot outside the pan.”</p>

<p>He therefore shook his head when Fargo signaled.
When the big backstop changed the sign,
Lefty, after a glance at the base runners, used a
short, swift delivery, and passed up an inshoot, intending
to keep the ball close to the knuckles of
the batter.</p>

<p>Schaeffer stepped in, and was unable to dodge
that shoot. It caught him glancingly, high up on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
the body, and made him stagger a bit. Then,
growling a few choice epithets, he obeyed the umpire’s
signal to take his base.</p>

<p>“That man stepped out of his box, Mr. Umpire,”
Fargo protested. “He wouldn’t have been
hit if he’d kept his place.”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut that out!” snarled Schaeffer, limping
in an exaggerated manner. “I was hit a-purpose.
Just wait, my young squab,” he added out of the
corner of his mouth to Lefty. “I’ll get <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>The umpire refused to reverse his decision.</p>

<p>As he took the ball from Fargo, Lefty’s blood
was tingling, and his face flushed. He managed
to keep a grip on his temper, however. With
the bases full and only one out, coolness was at a
premium.</p>

<small>TAKING A BRACE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Sickening!” growled Bert Elgin sitting
on the bench. “But what can you expect
with a dub like Locke on the slab?”</p>

<p>Andy Whalen, a little sore at having been left
out of the game, nodded absently. Next instant,
however, he turned his eyes from the diamond
for a second to glance at his companion.</p>

<p>“It isn’t altogether his fault, though,” he said.
“It’s no cinch to start in pitching to a perfectly
strange lot of batters, and Schaeffer shouldn’t
have had that base.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it,” snapped Elgin. “If
we had a real pitcher—”</p>

<p>“A hit!” Whalen cried. “No, it isn’t, either.
It’s going straight at Burley.”</p>

<p>Springing to his feet, he watched the ball soaring
out into left field; saw Tom Burley running
back to get under it; held his breath as the white
sphere dropped swiftly, apparently straight into
the fielder’s hands; and then sank back on the
bench with a groan as the fellow muffed miserably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“Butterfingers!” he said bitterly. “Why
didn’t you hold it, you chunk of solid ivory!”</p>

<p>Cinch Brown trotted easily over the plate, and
Kenny, covering the ground with tremendous
strides, rounded third, and was urged on by the
coacher.</p>

<p>Lefty knew the sphere would be relayed. Disappointed
by the unexpected muff, it seemed to
him as if the ball would never reach the diamond.
In reality, Burley, trying to atone for his miserable
error, made a swift throw which sent the
horsehide straight into the baseman’s hands; and
Daly, whirling, lined it to the waiting backstop.</p>

<p>“Slide! Slide!” shrieked the spectators.</p>

<p>The advice was unnecessary. Kenny had already
launched himself, feet forward, at the plate,
and so great was his speed that he almost overreached
it. He managed to stop himself with one
leg across the rubber just as the ball plunked into
Fargo’s big mitt, and he was declared safe.</p>

<p>Amid the yell of delight which greeted this decision,
Locke turned just in time to see Schaeffer
streaking toward third. Apparently he hoped to
steal the base in the general excitement.</p>

<p>Lefty shouted warningly to Fargo, but the big
backstop, on the job, had already lined the sphere
to Terry Daly. The latter caught it astride the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
base, but Schaeffer slid feet foremost straight for
the sack, and spiked Daly, who dropped the ball.</p>

<p>A chorus of protest arose from the Hornets.
Schaeffer got up, slapping the dust from his
clothes and volubly voicing his regret at the incident.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” he said, as Daly limped off the field.
“Accidents will happen, you know. He should
have watched out for spikes, anyhow.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he caught Locke’s eye, and the
latter brought his teeth together with a click. He
felt sure that the thing had been done with deliberate
intention, and, in the fleeting glance he
exchanged with the Bronc twirler, a sudden determination
filled him to repay the man in the way
it would hurt the most.</p>

<p>As he walked slowly back to the slab and stood
waiting for Brennan to send out a new man to
take Daly’s place, a curious calm descended on
him. The outfielder’s error, coming on the heels
of all that went before, had brought Lefty to a
state of nervousness which would have been fatal
had it continued.</p>

<p>It did not. In a flash it had vanished, leaving
him cooler and more composed than he had been
at any time since the game began. His face was
so quietly indifferent that more than one player,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
catching a glimpse of it, frowningly recalled the
day he had thrown away that first game to the
regulars, and wondered with sinking hearts
whether he really was the quitter they had thought
him then.</p>

<p>“He’s done for,” muttered Elgin on the bench.
“They’ve got his goat. He’s given away the
game in the first inning.”</p>

<p>Andy Whalen made no reply. He was watching
Lefty keenly, and something in the southpaw’s
face made him doubt if Elgin was right. There
was no question of the sudden change which had
come over the pitcher, but whether it was for
better or worse seemed a question. With furrowed
brow, the cub backstop dropped his chin
into his hands, and waited.</p>

<p>Tony Vegaro, the wiry little Mexican shortstop,
was at the bat. Schaeffer jumped away from
third as Locke pitched, making a fake start for the
plate. He stopped short, and retreated almost
instantly, but behind him, Monte Harris, the experienced
third baseman whom Brennan had put
in, streaked to the sack like greased lightning, and
was ready for business. Lefty had pitched the
ball high to prevent bunting, thus sending it into
Fargo’s hands in such a way that the backstop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
did not have to waste a fraction of a second in
lining it to third.</p>

<p>There was a shout of warning from the coacher,
but it came too late. Schaeffer flung himself back
with outstretched hand, but the ball plunked into
Harris’ grasp, and he tagged the Texan an instant
before the latter’s fingers reached the sack.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” chuckled
the delighted Whalen. “Locke’s not so worse,
after all.”</p>

<p>“He had nothing to do with it,” snapped Elgin,
concealing his disappointment with an effort.</p>

<p>Schaeffer arose with a fierce scowl, protesting
that he had got back to the base safely. When
the umpire motioned him toward the bench, he
snarled out something about robbery, and moved
grudgingly away.</p>

<p>Lefty then proceeded to fan the next batter
with swiftness and dispatch; and the Hornets
romped in from the field, their spirits beginning to
rise at this unexpected finish of the inning.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br>
<small>THE TRICKY TWIRLER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Lefty approached the bench in a very
dubious state of mind. He was not at all
sure that this first inning might not prove
his last, and when he saw Ogan hurry up to the
manager and say something in a low tone of voice,
he fully expected to be told that he might ornament
the bench for the remainder of the game.</p>

<p>He tried to gain some idea of what was passing
through Brennan’s mind by watching his face, but
swiftly came to the conclusion that this was hopeless.
A mask of carved and painted wood could
not have been more impassive. The manager listened
to what the cub captain had to say, without
moving a muscle of his face. Then he spoke a few
rapid sentences, and Ogan turned away with a
nod.</p>

<p>“You’re up, Buck,” he said shortly. “Start us
off with a good one, old fellow.”</p>

<p>Fargo grinned, sauntered to the plate, and
tapped the rubber indolently with his war club.
Then he stood back, when Schaeffer, who seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
to have been unnecessarily slow in starting, requested
permission to limber his wing a bit. The
reason for this was soon apparent. The first ball
fairly made the air smoke, and it cut the plate in
half. The next was quite as speedy, but took a
sharp hop as it neared the pan. The third was a
whizzing curve.</p>

<p>“Showing off,” Fargo commented, as if to himself,
but in a voice which penetrated to Schaeffer’s
ears. “I thought that was it.”</p>

<p>Then he stepped into the box again, smiling at
the Texan twirler in a manner which seemed to
aggravate that individual not a little.</p>

<p>With a sneering uptilt at the corners of his
mouth, the slab man took Kenny’s signal and
whipped the ball over with terrific speed. The
speed was so great, in fact, that Fargo, in spite
of the exhibition he had witnessed a moment before,
struck a bit too late.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! Ho!” shouted Pete Nevens from
third. “He didn’t know it went by, Zack, old
Bronc!”</p>

<p>“Give him another sample,” urged the player
on first.</p>

<p>“Mebbe you’d like him to toss you one,” suggested
Kenny. “He’s got a nice little lob ball that
mebbe you can hit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>Buck Fargo simply smiled that wide smile of
his, and waited quietly, his eye on Schaeffer.</p>

<p>“Look out!” shouted the pitcher, as the ball
left his fingers the second time.</p>

<p>Fargo dodged instinctively, for the horsehide
had started straight at him with burning speed.
Only by bending swiftly and holding his bat far
over the plate did he escape being hit.</p>

<p>This was one of Schaeffer’s little tricks to disturb
the nerve of a batsman. With the finest sort
of control, he could usually put the ball wherever
he desired, and he chose on this occasion to send
it as close to Fargo as possible. He shook his
head with an air of relief as if he had feared he
might hit the backstop, and was glad he had not.</p>

<p>As he straightened up, Fargo made no comment.
He still smiled a little, but a close observer would
have noticed that his jaw was a bit firmer and his
lids slightly more drooping. If Schaeffer had
only stopped to think, he might have realized how
many, many times this Big League player had
faced just such tricky pitchers before, and how
perfectly he must have learned how to treat them.</p>

<p>This thought did not come to him, however.
Balancing himself on his toes, he took a wide
swing of his arm for speed, and lined the ball over.
It seemed to start exactly as the last one had, but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
as Fargo quite expected, it took such a sharp shoot
that it cut the plate almost in twain.</p>

<p>The big backstop was ready for it. He met it
directly over the pan, and sent it whistling above
the head of the Texan first baseman, who leaped
desperately and in vain for it.</p>

<p>By rapid work, the right fielder got the ball in
time to cut the hit down to a single.</p>

<p>Bill Hagin stepped blithely to the pan, and
Fargo danced away from first.</p>

<p>The Hornet backstop was a fast man on the
paths. To play for Jim Brennan a single season
a man had to be that, and Fargo had been three
years with the organization. Quick as a cat on his
feet, he seemed to know by intuition just when the
pitcher meant to deliver the ball to the batsman.
For this reason he was able to get under headway
in base stealing even before the horsehide left the
pitcher’s fingers. Although Schaeffer drove him
back several times, Fargo got his start on the first
ball handed up to Hagin, and was off like a racer.
Kenny made a fine throw the length of the diamond,
but it was a fraction of a second too slow.</p>

<p>Warned by the disastrous results of the last
attempt, Schaeffer made no effort to intimidate
the second batter. Hagin had the look of a man
who eats speed, and his record quite bore out that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
impression. The Texan worked so carefully that
he succeeded in getting two strikes on the outfielder,
but this seemed simply to put the latter
on his mettle. He finally placed his bat against
the horsehide with precision and force for a long
drive into deep center, which the fielder missed
by less than a foot.</p>

<p>Hagin was ready to take second on the throw-in,
while Fargo, hitting the high spots, rounded third,
and was urged home by the coacher. The ball was
sent to second, and Hagin was driven back to the
first station.</p>

<p>“Here’s where we tie up!” cried Ogan jubilantly.
“Here’s where we take the lead! Smash
her out, Sandy.”</p>

<p>Rollins, second baseman, stepped up with the
expression of one who has every intention of making
connections with the horsehide. Schaeffer
had recovered from his momentary annoyance,
and was on the job. He pulled the batter with the
first ball pitched, which curved beyond Rollins’
reach. Then came a foul tip, that counted as a
strike, and Sandy flushed a little as he stepped
into the box again.</p>

<p>“This time he’ll send over a hummer,” he
thought, taking a fresh grip on his stick.</p>

<p>Schaeffer went through the movements which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
seemed to indicate that he was going to whip the
ball over with terrific speed, but now, instead of a
scorcher, he sent in a ball that seemed to hang
and drag in the air, and Rollins struck too soon.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“That’s the goods, Zack!” laughed Kenny,
pounding his mitt. “They can’t touch you. Put
this sorrel-top in cold storage for me.”</p>

<p>“Only one down!” cried Fargo. “Show this
bunch of panhandlers what you can do when you
try, Red.”</p>

<p>Pollock stepped briskly to the plate, waited for
a ball which looked good to him, and smashed it
out for a single.</p>

<p>Hagin, fleet as the wind, had been held at second.
When Tom Burley came up, determined to
atone for his fielding error, the runner took advantage
of the catcher’s fumble of the first pitch,
pilfering third for all of the backstop’s quick recovery
and fine throw to the sack.</p>

<p>Burley evidently wanted to bunt, but Schaeffer
kept the ball too high, finally forcing the batter
into popping a weak infield fly, which was smothered
with ease.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you, old man,” Fargo said, in a low
tone, as Lefty passed him. “We’ve got to tie up
the score, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>As Lefty faced the Texas twirler, the latter’s
lip curled in that irritating sneer, and he promptly
returned to his tactics of trying to get the batter’s
nerve. Unfortunately for him, Locke did not rattle.
He ducked a couple of whizzers sent straight
at him, and then, when Schaeffer handed up his
famous inshoot, he lashed a sharp grounder into
the diamond, which smacked the pitcher squarely
on the instep.</p>

<p>There was a roar of pain, followed by a volley
of furious language from Schaeffer. Then, recovering
himself, he dove after the ball, secured
it, and lined it home.</p>

<p>It is probable that he had lost his head for an
instant. Had he remembered that two men were
out, he might have thrown to first and stopped the
score; for he could have caught Lefty. Apparently
he seemed to think that the only way to stop
it was to put the ball to the plate.</p>

<p>Bill Hagin had not been napping, however. At
the first crack of leather meeting wood, he shot
like a rocket toward home, slid feet foremost, and
Kenny got the ball on him only when his spikes
were shining above the platter.</p>

<p>In his rage Schaeffer poured forth a volley
of blackguarding language which got the umpire
after him, and he might have been put out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
game had not his backstop hustled out into the
diamond and grabbed him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Zack!” he snapped. “Keep
your trap shut, or you’ll be canned. Can you go
ahead with the game?”</p>

<p>The twirler, managing to choke down his wrath,
limped around the slab a few times, and then toed
the rubber again. He was still furious, however,
and Al Ogan landed on the first ball for a line-drive
over the head of the shortstop. But for a
phenomenal catch by Cinch Brown the Hornets
might have scored more tallies.</p>

<p>As Lefty came in from the field, he passed close
to the disgruntled pitcher, and if looks could kill
he would have been finished then and there.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you yet, you swelled-headed squirt!”
Schaeffer hissed. “Wait, that’s all—just wait!”</p>

<p>Locke smiled blandly. “Quit your beefing,”
he advised. “You’re making everybody tired.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI<br>
<small>ONCE TOO OFTEN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The Hornets were in high spirits as they
took the field. To be sure, the score was
no more than tied, but the expedition with
which those two runs had been made was most encouraging.
The sudden and effective brace Locke
had taken in the last inning removed, in a measure,
the fears some of his teammates had entertained
concerning his ability to handle the situation; and,
as they scattered to their places on the field, they
urged him to “go in and eat ’em up.”</p>

<p>Apparently that was just what Lefty meant to
do. The first batter seemed unable to connect
fairly with any of the balls passed up to him,
and he finally hoisted a foul back of the pan, which
Fargo smothered without difficulty.</p>

<p>When his successor, Gash Benkard, fanned, it
looked as if that half of the inning was going to
be a tame one.</p>

<p>In any game it is unwise to make predictions
of that sort, however. Games have been won
with no men on bases and two out, and this one
was still young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>Cinch Brown walked up to the pan, cool, confident,
ready to duplicate his performance of the
inning previous. He did not find it quite so easy,
however. He slashed ineffectively at two balls
pitched to him, but finally succeeded in dropping
a dopy little Texas leaguer over the infield.</p>

<p>Kenny followed him. He, too, had done well on
his first trip to the plate, and hoped to do better
now. He declined to nibble at Lefty’s teasers,
but stood, grimly immovable, waiting for one
which suited him. Nevertheless, the southpaw
fooled him with two handsome shoots, and then,
having a bit of leeway, tried a high, wide one.</p>

<p>Kenny did an unexpected thing. Reaching far
over the plate, he caught the ball within an inch
of the end of his bat, and sent it into deep right
field.</p>

<p>With perfect handling, it would not have been
dangerous. “Dolly” Walker had taken many
such drives with ease, but perhaps he was too
confident. At all events, the ball did not strike his
mitt quite squarely, seemed to hesitate an instant,
and then trickled unaccountably over the edge of
the leather, falling to the turf.</p>

<p>By the time the amazed and discomfited fielder
had snatched it up and lined it to first, Kenny was
safe on the sack, while Brown, who had apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
forgot that two were “down” already, slid
to second just ahead of the flying horsehide.</p>

<p>Schaeffer was exultant. “Got him on the
run!” he jeered. “He’s a cinch. Get in there,
Pete. A little single is all we want. A little
safety’s the goods! You know where to put it.”</p>

<p>Nevens hit into the diamond. The inning would
have ended then and there had not Sandy Rollins,
at second, fumbled the weak grounder and spent
valuable time chasing it around his feet.</p>

<p>Lefty felt a hot rush of anger stir within him.
Two such errors are enough to try the temper
of any pitcher, especially when he is working his
hardest. The inning should have ended minutes
before, and now the bases were full, and Zack
Schaeffer was swaggering to the pan, a confident
grin on his face.</p>

<p>The sight of him cooled Locke as swiftly and
completely as it had done once before that day.
He shifted the ball in his fingers, taking his time.
He hoped to fan this fellow.</p>

<p>Suddenly he pitched, and the ball shot upward
with a little jump, rising over the Texan’s bat as
he struck.</p>

<p>“Strike!” droned the umpire.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Ogan from first.
“Got him swinging like a garden gate, Lefty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>Schaeffer set his teeth, and the flesh seemed to
harden over his jaws. His eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>As before, Lefty took his time. When at
length he poised himself on his right foot, flung
back his arm, and brought it forward with a whiplike
motion, the sphere came humming over with
speed which almost made the air smoke.</p>

<p>Schaeffer struck again. This time he missed,
as before, but even as he swung he let go his hold
on the bat, which went spinning through the air
straight at Locke.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Fargo.</p>

<p>The southpaw ducked just in time to let the bat
pass over him. When he straightened up, he
stood for an instant, his eyes fixed on Schaeffer’s
face with an expression in them which showed a
little of the contempt that filled him.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon,” mumbled the batter. “Accident.”</p>

<p>Lefty knew the Texan lied. To be sure, a man
sometimes throws his bat in striking, but almost
never straight out into the diamond. Besides,
Schaeffer did not have the least appearance of
regret, unless it was regret that the stick had
missed its mark.</p>

<p>Locke made no comment, however. After the
man had recovered his bat, the southpaw stood for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
a moment, ball in hand, looking fixedly at him.
When he finally pitched, he used a delivery which
seemed to promise a swift one, but instead it was
the slowest sort of a slow ball. In spite of everything
he could do, Schaeffer struck too soon.</p>

<p>As the umpire’s voice sounded in his ears, a
snarl broke from the Texan’s lips. For an instant
it seemed almost that he meant to launch
his bat again straight at Locke’s head. Perhaps
he might have done so had it not been for the
warning clutch of Gash Benkard’s fingers on his
shoulder. Then, with a furious motion, he cast
the stick to the ground, and walked out to the
slab.</p>

<p>“Looks devilish, don’t he?” commented
Whalen, on the bench. “I wouldn’t be surprised
if he picked a fight with Locke after the game.”</p>

<p>“Wish he would!” growled Bert Elgin.</p>

<p>He had been growing more and more disgruntled
as the game progressed. The first ten
minutes had filled him with satisfaction at the
apparently poor showing made by his rival, but as
the latter improved Elgin’s temper became more
and more unrestrainable.</p>

<p>“You seem to have it in for him,” Whalen remarked
pointedly. “Strikes me he got out of
that hole pretty neat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“Bah!” retorted Elgin. “What did he get
into it for? Any pitcher who knows his business
would never let the bases fill with two out, the
way he did.”</p>

<p>“Wow-wow!” barked the cub backstop. “I
s’pose it’s his fault that Walker dropped that fly
and Sandy muffed a grounder that any kid should
have nailed. Whew! Did you see that? That
fellow had better be careful. One of these days
he’ll bean a batter and put him out of business.
Sore as a crab, I reckon, at being fanned.”</p>

<p>Schaeffer was certainly vicious. Twice Monte
Harris had barely escaped balls sent straight at
him. He was no quitter, but he had a notion of his
own value in the Big League, and did not relish
being put out of business by a wild busher who had
lost his temper. Having protested to the umpire
without avail, he reached for a wide outcurve,
popped a weak fly into the diamond, and retired to
the bench.</p>

<p>“That gink is going to get his one of these
days,” he remarked to Brennan. “Why don’t
you make him behave, Jim?”</p>

<p>The manager made no reply, but, rising to his
feet, walked slowly toward the plate. He had not
taken half a dozen steps when the accident happened.
Dolly Walker had stepped into the box,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
and apparently Schaeffer sized him up for easy
meat. He promptly launched one of his cannon-ball
whistlers at him, and the fielder was either
too slow or too obstinate to get out of the way.</p>

<p>There was a sickening thud; a smothered sound,
half groan, half cry. Half a dozen men leaped
forward to catch the swaying figure, from whose
nerveless fingers the bat had slipped. No one
was quick enough. It was the startled backstop
of the Texans who thrust out his arms instinctively,
and then stood helplessly holding the limp
body and staring down at the white face resting
against his chest protector. All could see that the
man was seriously hurt.</p>

<small>THE SPIKING OF SCHAEFFER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Instantly the whole field was in an uproar.
The Hornets, fighting mad, invaded the diamond
in a body. Schaeffer, his face white
as that of the unconscious man, half turned as if
to run. Then he straightened up and faced the
music.</p>

<p>“It—wasn’t my fault,” he stammered. “He
was out of his box. He couldn’t get away from
my inshoot.”</p>

<p>“You lie!” said Buck Fargo. “You tried to
hit him. You’ve played that trick once too often,
and I’m—going to hand you something!”</p>

<p>He lunged at Schaeffer, who stepped back
swiftly and threw up his hands. In an instant
the crowd surged around him, shutting out those
of his friends who were racing to his assistance.
Fargo was on the point of swinging at the Texan’s
jaw when suddenly the fellow staggered, his face
contorted with pain, a yell issued from his bloodless
lips.</p>

<p>“I’m spiked!” he cried furiously. “Lemme
get my hands on the dog that did it! I’ll—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>His eyes met those of Lefty Locke, who stood
close beside him on the right, and in a second
both arms shot forward, his muscular fingers fastening
with a convulsive grip on the southpaw’s
throat.</p>

<p>“You hound!” he frothed, emphasizing each
word by a vicious shake. “You’ve put me out of
business. I can’t play for weeks. It’s my
left—”</p>

<p>At this point Locke recovered from his astonishment,
and, with a desperate effort, managed to
tear the hands from their choking hold.</p>

<p>“I never touched you,” he denied. “I
wouldn’t—”</p>

<p>Wild with pain and rage, Schaeffer frothed out
an insult, and Lefty promptly dealt him an open-hander
on the mouth.</p>

<p>Cries of approval greeted the blow. Fargo was
trying to get into the mix-up, and others showed
their desire to have a hand in the Texan’s punishment.
The latter’s fist shot out, but Locke parried
skillfully. Three or four of the visiting team
arrived on the run, and a general fight was imminent.
The crowd was suddenly thrust aside, and
Jim Brennan appeared.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” he roared, grasping Lefty’s wrist
and stepping between the men. His face was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
purple with anger, and his eyes glowed like twin
sparks. “What do you think you’re doing?”</p>

<p>“He spiked me!” snarled Schaeffer. “The cur
spiked me! Look at that foot.”</p>

<p>The manager glanced downward, and saw instantly
that Schaeffer was not bluffing. Across
his left shoe, the gouging marks of spikes were
plainly visible. On one of them a faint crimson
smear was showing. Brennan frowned and
raised his eyes.</p>

<p>“Somebody stepped on you by accident,” he
said shortly.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” rasped Schaeffer. “He done it a-purpose.
I felt his foot jab down on me. He had
it in for me all along.”</p>

<p>“Who are you talking about?” Brennan
asked.</p>

<p>“Him!” retorted the pitcher, glaring at Locke.
“I knew he’d be up to some dirty trick.”</p>

<p>Lefty met the manager’s searching glance with
perfect calm. “I never touched him,” he averred
emphatically. “I was itching to smash one into
him for knocking Dolly out, but spiking isn’t my
style.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Brennan’s keen eyes roved around
the circle of faces. “Anybody know anything
about this?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>There was a chorus of denial, and the manager
turned back to Schaeffer.</p>

<p>“I’ll look into it,” he promised. “I’ll stand
for anything but dirty business, and any man
who’d do a thing like this gets the gaff, I don’t
care who he is.”</p>

<p>He hesitated for an instant, and his jaw squared.
“As for you,” he went on harshly, his keen eyes
boring the Texan’s flushed face, “you’re rotten.
Talk about dirty playing! If I’d had any idea
what sort of a cheap roughneck you were, this
game would never have started. You can bet your
boots I’ll take pains to let people know just what
you are, and I kind of think you’ll have a hard
job finding a decent team after this that’ll have
anything to do with you. See?”</p>

<p>He stood glaring at the Texan, who for once
had nothing to say. Presently Brennan’s eyes
swept the circle again.</p>

<p>“No rough-house!” he snapped shortly. “You
boys better beat it back to the hotel. There won’t
be anything more doing to-day. Dolly’s come to
and gone along with a couple of the men. This
game’s finished. Get started now. There’s been
enough monkey-shines to-day.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, and with many savage glances at
Schaeffer, the Hornets obeyed. It came hard to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
leave the scoundrel that way, but they knew Brennan
meant what he said, and so they gave in.</p>

<p>“Serves him good and right,” said Andy
Whalen, as he caught up with Elgin. “I’m
blamed glad the cur got something to cook him,
and I’ll be hanged if I blame any fellow for spiking
him. Wonder who it was? Didn’t you see
anything, Bert?”</p>

<p>He looked curiously at Elgin, who shook his
head promptly.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” the latter answered. “First I
knew anything was wrong was when he yelled he
was spiked. I wouldn’t wonder if it was an accident,
anyhow. With everybody pushing and
shoving, somebody likely stepped on him without
meaning to.”</p>

<p>“Nix!” retorted the cub backstop. “I took a
good look at his foot, and, believe me, it wasn’t
no accident. It was a good hard stamp, done
on purpose.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be the opinion of those who had
been near the Texan when the incident occurred,
and much curiosity was expressed as to who could
have been the perpetrator of the affair.</p>

<p>The general sentiment was that Schaeffer had
been well repaid for his dirty work on the slab;
but the more thoughtfully inclined, knowing Jim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
Brennan’s temperament, wondered what would
happen if the manager ever found out who had
done the spiking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII<br>
<small>THE TELEGRAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The days passed without the truth coming
to light. At first Brennan set about
systematically interviewing every man
who had been on the field that day, but without
avail. Having failed to arrive at the truth in this
manner, and other and more important matters
coming up to take his time, he seemed to drop
the subject. Those who knew him, however, realized
that it would always remain tucked away in
some corner of his brain until he had finally solved
the mystery.</p>

<p>The work of training proceeded rapidly and
successfully to its conclusion as the end of March
approached. Each afternoon the cubs fought out
their losing battle with the regulars on the diamond.
The latter were getting into splendid
shape, and their opponents had almost forgotten
what it felt like to win a game.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they never gave up, or slackened
their efforts, for the net was drawing closer and
closer about them day by day. Every now and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
then a youngster would drop out of the race. He
was not yet ready for the big game, and had
either been sold by the manager, farmed out to a
minor league, or released unconditionally.</p>

<p>Of the cub pitchers, only two remained, Locke
and Elgin. They were both remarkably good in
their way, and the other players were divided as
to their relative merits. The almost universal conclusion
was that Brennan would keep both with the
organization unless something unexpected occurred
to give him reason for changing his mind.</p>

<p>Lefty worked strenuously without a let-up. He
knew his doubtful points almost as well as the
manager himself, and strove with all his might to
correct them.</p>

<p>Hard as the labor was physically, the southpaw
found it anything but disagreeable. He was well
liked by most of the regulars and a great many
of the cubs. In Buck Fargo he found a real
chum whom he came to admire and think better
of every day. When the diminishing number of
players made a readjustment of rooms at the hotel
desirable, Locke accepted with alacrity the big
backstop’s invitation to come in with him, an arrangement
which proved pleasant and satisfactory.</p>

<p>With Bert Elgin and his little group of cronies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
the southpaw had nothing whatever to do. The
former had apparently resigned himself to the
inevitable, and, since it looked as if both cub
pitchers were going to be retained, he seemed to
have given up his efforts to injure his rival.</p>

<p>There were just two things which marred
Lefty’s pleasure and absolute peace of mind.
The first was Jim Brennan’s attitude of noncommittal
impassiveness. Try as he would, the southpaw
found it impossible to break down the barrier
of reserve between them. No matter how good
a showing the cub might make on the field, he
never succeeded in eliciting a word of praise from
the manager. The latter always gave the young
twirler an impression of withholding judgment,
a feeling that he was continually searching for
something in Locke which he was constantly expecting
but had failed to find.</p>

<p>At first Lefty thought it was simply his ordinary
manner. Then, when he noticed the manager
unbend time after time to others, he reached
the conclusion that Brennan had never forgotten
the circumstances of the recruit’s arrival at training
camp, and that he still felt resentment at the
manner in which Locke had been, as it were, thrust
down his throat.</p>

<p>The explanation of this latter fact had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
absurdly simple. Lefty learned in a roundabout
way that Jimmy Toler’s letter had traveled to
Ashland, Tennessee, and drifted on to the Texan
town a couple of days after the busher’s arrival.
It seemed incredible that any man could harbor
such a thing so long, but Brennan was peculiar in
many ways, and Lefty could think of no other reason
for his conduct.</p>

<p>The other matter which marred his contentment
was the fact that Janet, while actually in
the same State, was just beyond his reach. It
was more tantalizing than if she had remained in
that far-away New England town. They corresponded
regularly, of course, but letters are always
more or less unsatisfactory. Only once had
he obtained permission to be away over Sunday,
and Brennan’s grudging acquiescence to his request
made him resolve never to repeat it.</p>

<p>And so the time passed until there remained
less than two days more at Ashland. On the
twenty-fifth the training quarters would be deserted,
and the teams, separating, would commence
their homeward march by easy stages and different
routes, playing exhibition games with minor-league
organizations along the way.</p>

<p>The days had sped with such swiftness that
Lefty could scarcely believe the end to be so near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
when he arose that morning, and could say that to-morrow
they would start. There was no doubting
the fact, however, and, what was more, that very
afternoon, a game had been arranged with one of
the most prominent teams of the Southern
League. It was the first chance the Hornets
had been given to play against outsiders
since that brief, disastrous contest with the
Broncs, and they were agog with eager anticipation.
The Flamingoes were in quite a different
class from the bush organization of so-called Texans,
and the game was likely to be exceedingly
close. Lefty was to start off on the slab, so Brennan
had briefly informed him the afternoon before.
The youngster wondered whether the manager
had any special motive in picking him.</p>

<p>As the squad started for the field after breakfast,
Lefty discovered that he had forgotten his
glove, and hurried upstairs for it, telling Fargo
that he would be along shortly. When he came
down he raced through the lobby and almost upset
a small boy in uniform who was coming up the
steps.</p>

<p>“Say, mister,” the latter inquired, as he recovered
his balance, “is Tom Locke inside?”</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” Lefty answered swiftly.
“What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>The boy drew a yellow envelope from his pocket,
and Locke snatched it with that queer, sinking
feeling which an unexpected missive of the sort
usually arouses. Tearing it swiftly open, he
brought forth the sheet and unfolded it with a
single motion.</p>

<p>As his eyes took in the contents at a glance, he
drew his breath swiftly, his face turning a shade
less brown. The message had been sent from
Billings, Texas, that morning. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">Father is dying. Come at once. I am all alone.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Janet.</span><br></p>
</div>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV<br>
<small>NOTHING ELSE POSSIBLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Any answer?”</p>

<p>Lefty raised his head and stared
stupidly at the boy for an instant.
Then he came to himself.</p>

<p>“Yes! Give me a pencil—quick!”</p>

<p>Snatching the stub from the other’s hand, he
turned the message over, placed the paper against
the side of the building, and hastily scrawled a
few words.</p>

<p>“There!” he exclaimed, thrusting it at the boy;
“send that off right away. Don’t lose a minute.
Here. Keep the change.”</p>

<p>It was a silver dollar he handed the boy. Without
waiting for thanks, he darted back into the
hotel, hastily secured a time-table, and found that
there was a train leaving in less than half an hour.
It was only after he had reached his room and begun
to strip off his baseball togs that he realized
he must let Brennan know in some way of what
he planned to do.</p>

<p>“There’s no ’phone at the park,” he muttered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
throwing a shoe into a corner. “I haven’t time,
anyway.”</p>

<p>He tore off his stockings, flung shirt and trousers
on the floor, and made a dive for his street
clothes.</p>

<p>“Still, they’ll all be back here for dinner,” he
went on aloud. “If I leave a note with Buck,
he’ll put the old man wise. It’s tough! Poor
little girl!”</p>

<p>His voice broke just the least bit, but he went
on rapidly with his dressing, and in less than ten
minutes was ready to go. He gave no thought to
the consequences of his leaving in this manner
and at this time. Janet had called him for help;
he must go to her. Besides, even Brennan, though
he might growl and grumble a little, would understand
how impossible it was for him to take any
other course.</p>

<p>Finding a sheet of paper, Lefty hastily scrawled
a note to Buck, telling his chum where he had
gone and why, and asking him to inform the manager.
Having folded the paper and written
Fargo’s name on the outside, he placed it on the
middle of the table, where the big backstop could
not fail to see it the instant he entered the
room.</p>

<p>That finished, he snatched his hat, and darted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
down the stairs without waiting for the elevator.
At the station he had nearly fifteen minutes to
wait, but at last the train pulled in.</p>

<p>Lefty thought that the journey would never
end. The train seemed to crawl along at a snail’s
speed, stopping at every little hamlet by the way.
He blamed the doctor at Kingsbridge for having
suggested such an impossibly out-of-the-way place
as Billings. He kept looking at his watch till he
might better have held it in his hand. He bought
a paper, and tossed it away unread. He opened
a magazine, only to fling it aside impatiently.
And all the time the thought of Janet, alone and
helpless in this terrible situation, never left his
mind.</p>

<p>At Flat Rock Junction he had to change to another
road. There was an exasperating wait of
three-quarters of an hour, during which he nearly
wore a rut in the wooden platform. Another
weary, interminable hour followed; but at last,
shortly after one, he flung himself off the still-moving
train at Billings, and dashed up the main
street.</p>

<p>The air was soft and warm and caressing.
Trees and shrubs were bursting into leaf; flowers
were everywhere. Here and there a bird caroled
joyously, and the sound stabbed Lefty like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
thrust of a knife. How could any living thing be
joyful when her father lay dying?</p>

<p>Rounding a corner, he scarcely dared look at
the house where they had taken lodgings. Perhaps
he had come too late. Perhaps it was all
over.</p>

<p>He reached the wooden gate and thrust it open.
A rustle of skirts sounded on the vine-clad porch,
the quick catching of a breath, then a cry of glad
surprise:</p>

<p>“Why, Lefty!”</p>

<p>She started up from the rocking-chair, her face
pink and her eyes sparkling. A little smile curved
the corners of her tender mouth, bringing out the
dimple which had always fascinated him.</p>

<p>The man stared up in petrified astonishment.
What did it mean? Was he dreaming, or had she
gone daft?</p>

<p>“Why, Lefty!” she exclaimed again. “This is
splendid! How did you ever manage to get
away?”</p>

<p>He swallowed hard and, without knowing what
he did, wiped beads of perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>“I came,” he gasped. “Your—father, Janet?”</p>

<p>A little frown of perplexity came into her forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“Father?” she repeated. “Why, he’s all right.
The springs are doing him no end of good. He’s
taking his nap just now. Did you—”</p>

<p>“You didn’t send me a telegram this morning,
then?” Locke interrupted in a strange voice.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. Why should I? I wrote
you last night, but it was only— Lefty! What is
it? For goodness sake, tell me what has
happened.”</p>

<p>The skin over his jaws was hard as marble.
The blood had rushed into his face, turning it a
dull crimson under the brown, and bringing out a
throbbing vein in his temple in bold relief. His
lips were pressed tightly together, and the eyes
fixed on the girl were not his eyes. They were
wide open and almost black, full of cold, consuming
wrath. They frightened Janet Harting, and
made her step back involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Lefty!” she cried again. “What is it?
What makes you look so?”</p>

<p>For an instant he did not answer. He had realized
the bitter truth. The telegram was a forgery,
sent for the sole and only purpose of getting him
out of the way at the very time of all others during
his baseball career that he should have been on
the job. In a flash an illumination which comes
too seldom to a man told him that Brennan’s reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
for putting him on the slab to-day was in the
nature of a final test of his ability. The other
game had shown the manager nothing. This
would have been the ultimate proof of his fitness
to be retained as a member of the squad—and he
would not be there to take advantage of the chance.</p>

<p>Swiftly he glanced at his watch, the girl staring
anxiously at him the while. He took out a
crumpled time-table. The first train left at two-twenty.
As he thrust the time-table back into his
pocket, his face relaxed a little and a faint smile
twisted the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>“There’s been an unfortunate—mistake,
Janet,” he said quietly. “I’ll come up and tell
you about it.”</p>

<p>He had remembered the one consoling feature
of the whole miserable business. Buck would
surely find the letter and explain the matter to
Brennan. The manager would doubtless be
angry, but, after all, it was not as bad as if no
word at all had been left.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV<br>
<small>FOR WANT OF A LIE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Locke would scarcely have been so self-contained
had he known what had taken
place at the hotel about the time he was
feverishly pacing the platform at Flat Rock Junction.</p>

<p>Through some pretext, Bert Elgin managed to
leave the ground a few minutes ahead of the others.
He had concealed his nervousness all morning,
taking hope from the nonappearance of Lefty on
the field, and reveling in Brennan’s openly expressed
anger at the puzzling occurrence. But
now he felt that he must find out something
definite.</p>

<p>Arriving at the hotel, he hastened up to the corridor
above his own, taking care to use the stairs
for the last flight, and made his way to a certain
door, which he pushed open without ceremony.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood staring curiously around
the disordered room. Then a triumphant smile
curved his lips, and his eyes danced maliciously.</p>

<p>“Looks like the kid worked it, all right,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
in a low tone. “I was afraid he might slip up
on something. What’s this?”</p>

<p>Striding over to the table, he picked up the note
addressed to Buck Fargo, opening it without hesitation.
Having read it hastily through, he smiled
again and thrust it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“‘Tell Brennan all about it,’” he quoted, in a
jeering voice, “‘and make him understand how I
had to go.’ I guess we won’t tell anybody; it’ll
be lots more fun to keep ’em guessing till you
come back.”</p>

<p>He hastened to the door, and stepped out into
the hall. “I should say your goose was cooked
nice and brown,” he muttered, with venomous
satisfaction. “I wouldn’t give a whole lot for
your chances with the Hornets after this little
performance.”</p>

<p>Happily for Lefty’s peace of mind, he guessed
nothing of all this. As it was, he had worries
enough to keep him company during that maddeningly
slow trip back to Ashland. Time and
again he went over the situation from the beginning,
trying his best to see it from Jim Brennan’s
point of view, and always he ended by a despairing
grasp on that one frail straw: the manager might
forgive the desertion as long as the absent man had
done his best to let him know about it beforehand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>Stepping off the train shortly after seven, the
southpaw went at once to the hotel. The first
man he ran into in the lobby was Buck Fargo.
The expression on his chum’s face made Lefty’s
heart sink into his boots.</p>

<p>“Where the deuce have you been?” the backstop
inquired directly, and with force. “How’d
you happen to duck?”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Buck,” the young pitcher
appealed fervently, “don’t tell me you didn’t get
my note?”</p>

<p>“If it explained what in thunder made you do
such a fool trick as this, I most certainly didn’t,”
Fargo returned.</p>

<p>Locke groaned aloud. “I left it on the table.
I told you just what had happened and why I had
to rush off. I asked you to explain to the old
man—”</p>

<p>Catching a sudden warning in Fargo’s eyes,
Lefty stopped abruptly and turned slowly around.
Brennan stood just behind him, his hands on his
hips, an expression on his square, heavy-jowled
face which even the big backstop had rarely seen
there before.</p>

<p>“Well?” he questioned in an ominous voice,
his sharp, deep-set eyes boring into Lefty’s brown
ones. “Did I hear you say anything about an explanation?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Strikes me it’s about time something
of the sort was dished up.”</p>

<p>His voice, cold, hard, and unrelenting, sent a
flicker up and down Locke’s spine. If the man
had only flared out at him, roared, bellowed, it
would have been better than this. But that harsh,
flinty, absolutely pitiless tone struck a chill to the
youngster’s heart, and quenched the last spark of
hope in him.</p>

<p>“I had—a telegram—this morning,” he explained
unevenly. “It came just as I was leaving
for the field. It was from—a close friend of mine
who is at Billings, with her father. She said that
her father was dying, and asked me to come at
once. She was all alone in a strange place. They
knew no one. They had been in the South only
a few weeks. I <em>had</em> to go.”</p>

<p>He hesitated an instant, glancing desperately at
Brennan’s face. Something in it—the flicker of
an eyelash, perhaps, or the faintest possible relaxing
of that steely, set expression,—made a tiny
spark of hope revive in Lefty’s breast.</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” growled Brennan.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t time to send you word,” Locke
continued. “I had to make the nine-five train.
So I wrote a note to Fargo explaining things, and
asked him to tell you about it. I left it on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
table in our room. You must have missed it, Buck,
or didn’t you go to the room?”</p>

<p>He turned eagerly to his friend, but the latter
shook his head.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any note,” he said slowly. “I
was up there at noon and again to-night. There
ain’t nothing on the table but a couple of magazines
and a lamp. Mebbe it got blown off.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps that was it,” Lefty agreed. “I
wrote it and stuck it up where you’d see it the
first thing.”</p>

<p>He glanced again at Brennan and met the man’s
searching gaze unflinchingly. For an instant
there was silence as the manager scowled deeply
to hide his annoyance.</p>

<p>“You’d ought to have sent word,” he snapped.
“You knew you was to pitch this afternoon.
Why didn’t you leave a letter with the clerk, addressed
to me?”</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” Lefty apologized.
“I was so shaken up and worried and rushed that
I couldn’t seem to think of anything but making
that train.”</p>

<p>The spark of hope had been fanned into a little
blaze. Brennan was certainly relenting.
Everything about him pointed to that. He stared
at the cub pitcher from under his bushy eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
for a moment or two as if vainly searching for
something more to find fault with.</p>

<p>“You seem to have got back mighty sudden,”
he said presently, in a tart voice. “Must have
taken the first train. Didn’t your friend’s father
die?”</p>

<p>It had come, the question which Lefty had been
dreading from the beginning and trying to get
away from! For an instant he was tempted—desperately
tempted. The manager was plainly influenced
in his favor. If he lied and told some
plausible story of Mr. Harting’s sudden recovery,
all would be well, and the matter would probably
be dropped. If he told the truth and admitted
that no message had ever been sent—</p>

<p>In that second of hesitation, many things flashed
through his mind. He was already morally certain
that he had Bert Elgin to thank for the trick.
He told himself that a lie which would result in
foiling the plotter would be no lie at all. The
very words of a glib falsehood were on his lips
when suddenly he brought his teeth together and
threw back his head. He would tell the truth at
any cost.</p>

<p>“He was never sick at all,” he said swiftly,
his face rather pale.</p>

<p>Brennan stared. “Never sick!” he repeated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
sharply. “Then what in time did she send the
telegram for, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>Lefty thrust both hands behind his back, gripping
the fingers tightly together. His eyes met
Brennan’s squarely.</p>

<p>“She didn’t. She knew nothing about it. It
was sent by some one else.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>The words came from Brennan’s lips like bullets.
Suspicion, incredulity, anger, showed in his
piercing eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Lefty answered. “It looks as
if some one wanted to get me away from the
game.”</p>

<p>Brennan’s laugh was harsh and mirthless.
“That’s likely, ain’t it? That’s a clever idea,
that is! Where’s the telegram? Show it to me.”</p>

<p>With leaden heart, Locke remembered what he
had done with it. “I haven’t—got it,” he stammered.
“I wrote a message on the back—and
gave it to the boy to send.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” sneered the manager. “Did it
get to the girl? Did it come while you were
there?”</p>

<p>“N-o.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. It never went. Just so the
other never came.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“But it did come,” protested Lefty, though he
had a feeling that further words were futile.
“The boy handed it to me on the steps. I opened
it, and wrote an answer right there. That’s the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” retorted the manager incredulously.
“Just you wait a minute and I’ll find out if it is
or not.”</p>

<p>Turning abruptly, he hurried over to a telephone
booth and shut himself in. The instant
the manager’s back was turned Buck Fargo
groaned.</p>

<p>“What the devil did you tell him for?” he said
sadly. “I’m afraid you’ve gone and done for
yourself, kid. I have never seen the old man in
such a temper since Billy Smith sold a game to
the Pinks last spring.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to lie,” the youngster confessed, “but
I simply couldn’t, Buck.”</p>

<p>“You’re awful particular! Who do you s’pose
done it, that cur Elgin?”</p>

<p>“I can’t think of any one else equal to it,” Lefty
answered. “It wouldn’t be the first miserable
trick he’s worked.”</p>

<p>He broke off as a door slammed and Brennan
came striding toward them, his eyes savage and
his face the color of a beet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“I knew it!” he said. “No such message went
through the office.”</p>

<p>He paused a second, his legs spread wide apart,
regarding Lefty with a cold, contemptuous
scrutiny.</p>

<p>“I’m through with you!” he burst out, at length.
“I can put up with a lot, but I haven’t any use
for a quitter. I thought you was one when I first
saw you, but now I know. You skipped out to-day
because you were afraid—nothing else. You
pretty near pulled me with that tale of yours—but
not quite. You fooled me with that dirty
spiking trick, too, but I’m wise now. I’m done
with you! Go back to the bushes or the hot place,
whichever you prefer!”</p>

<p>He wheeled round and took a few steps across
the lobby. Suddenly he turned back.</p>

<p>“Mebbe you’re thinking of that fine offer you
say was made by the Blue Stockings?” he sneered.
“I wouldn’t give much for your chances with Jack
Kennedy.”</p>

<p>Lefty’s eyes were blazing. His lips parted for
a hot retort, but he seemed to change his mind
and choke it down. For an instant he stood absolutely
still. Then, slowly, he turned and looked
at Fargo.</p>

<p>Neither man spoke.</p>

<small>DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The quickness with which a man can be forgotten
is never flattering to his self-esteem.
For a full month Lefty Locke had been
a member of the Hornets’ training camp squad.
During all that time he had been well liked by the
majority of the older men, and admitted by some
to terms of intimacy which are rarely accorded
a new recruit. Ever since the strenuous contest
with the team of Texas bushers his fellow cubs
had also made him one of them in every sense of
the word.</p>

<p>Then came the catastrophe. For a brief space
his name was in every mouth. The players took
sides on the question of Brennan’s judgment,
some contending that the manager was right,
others voicing their continued faith in the disgraced
player.</p>

<p>But with the departure of Locke from Ashland,
followed swiftly by that of the entire squad, the
subject soon palled. There was so much else of
vital personal interest that even those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
had championed the unfortunate pitcher’s cause
became more and more indifferent. Some, even,
hearing the cleverly phrased traducements which
Bert Elgin never lost a chance to utter regarding
his former rival, came to the conclusion that they
had been deceived. Jim Brennan rarely made a
mistake in sizing up a man. There must, after all,
have been a yellow streak in the young pitcher
which he successfully concealed from all save the
lynx-eyed manager.</p>

<p>So at the end of one short week it is doubtful
whether more than three men out of all that number
wasted a single thought on the youngster who
had, a brief time before, been so popular with
them.</p>

<p>Buck Fargo did not forget; he was not built
that way. Esteemed as he was among players
generally, and adored by the fans, it was, nevertheless,
a fact that the big backstop did not
usually make friends quickly—that is, what he
called real friends, as opposed to pleasant but
casual acquaintances.</p>

<p>Somehow, Lefty had attracted him from the
first. He liked the way the boy had taken Elgin’s
part that night at the Palace Theater and stood
up unflinchingly against heavy odds. He liked
Locke’s attitude with his fellow recruits when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
started the boycott against him early in the season.
The way the southpaw set out to conquer his faults
and improve his playing appealed strongly to
Fargo, who had been obliged to labor quite as
steadily and strenuously himself before reaching
his present enviable position. And when, little by
little, he had come to know the youngster better,
the Big Leaguer’s liking changed to something
deeper and more abiding, which made it quite impossible
for him to forget.</p>

<p>At first he had been openly angry. He berated
Brennan for a blind idiot, and had to be forcibly
restrained from punching Elgin’s head. Then he
wanted Lefty to stay with the crowd on a chance of
the manager coming to his senses. He soon saw,
however, what an impossible condition of affairs
that would bring about, and reluctantly, though
with much outward brevity, said good-by.</p>

<p>“You’ll write, of course, and let me know how
you make out?” he urged. “I ain’t much of a
hand with the pen, but I’ll guarantee to answer
every letter right off.”</p>

<p>There was a queer expression in Lefty’s eyes.
He was finding the phases of the situation even
more difficult than he had supposed. It was not
easy to keep in place the mask of indifference he
had assumed the night before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll write when I make good, Buck,” he returned
quietly. “There won’t be anything to tell
you till then.”</p>

<p>Argument was futile. His mind was made up.
He told no one his plans. It seemed doubtful
whether he had made any. He simply said good-by
and went his way, leaving behind ripples of
discussion and conjecture, which swiftly spread
out with ever-lessening volume until, like the departed
pitcher, they vanished as if they had never
been.</p>

<p>Fargo’s one consolation was in Jack Stillman.
He found the newspaper man’s feelings in perfect
accord with his own. There was one difference,
however: while the big backstop was
ready and eager to do anything in his power to
rehabilitate his friend, no way occurred to him;
it was Stillman’s brain, trained by three years of
reporting on a metropolitan newspaper, which hit
upon the only possible manner in which that
could be done.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to find the boy who delivered that
message,” he said tersely as they left the station.
“If we can get hold of him and manage to choke
the truth out of him, we ought to be able to nail
this crooked trick fast to the man who put up the
job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>He began working to that end at once. But
the time was very short. The two squads—cubs
and regulars—were leaving that very afternoon,
and the task of finding an unknown boy in the
few hours remaining, even though he had been
foresighted enough to obtain an accurate description
of the fellow from Lefty, was next to impossible.</p>

<p>As it was, Stillman risked a call-down from his
editor by staying over a day at Ashland. When he
finally left to catch up with the team he was
scheduled to accompany North, he had found no
clew, but had placed the matter in the hands of a
retired member of the San Antonio police force
living in the smaller town.</p>

<p>William Bowers was shrewder than the ordinary
run of officers. He had been a sergeant for
years, and time hung heavily on his hands. He
might succeed, and he might not. Stillman felt
that the result would be a toss-up. But it was the
best he could do.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII<br>
<small>OPENING THE SEASON</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Slowly and leisurely the Hornets zigzagged
their way northward, pausing here
and there to play an exhibition game with
some minor-league team, which was usually won
by headwork and experience rather than by any extraordinary
display of hitting. Even after the
regular period of work at the training camp, the
big fellows were not wielding the hickory with
special effect.</p>

<p>They shaped rapidly into condition, however,
and, when the time came to face some of the
stronger teams of the minor-league clubs above
what was once known as Mason and Dixon’s line,
they did not disgrace themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, with much rejoicing, the metropolis was
reached and the two squads reunited. Jim Brennan,
his mind finally made up after weeks of
close watching and weighing, proceeded to discard
the few remaining recruits who, in his
opinion, had shown themselves not quite ripe.</p>

<p>Then, with the squad trimmed down to the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
at which it would remain throughout the
season, a week or more of hard, strenuous work
ensued. A new infielder had to be broken in by
his veteran comrades to the finer intricacies of
the game. New signals were devised and perfected.
Various pitchers were tried out, one after
the other, in a full nine-inning game, and their condition
studied by the astute manager. The batting
order was decided on. In fact, everything
was done which could be done in preparation for
that great occasion to which many thousands of
enthusiastic fans had been looking forward so
ardently—opening day.</p>

<p>It came at last, with its tricky April breezes
giving the lie to cloudless skies and brilliant yellow
sunshine. There were the same joyous, pushing
crowds, the same blaring bands. Some of
the men had heard them many, many times before;
but even they, though they might dissemble
and pretend a careless nonchalance, were conscious,
nevertheless, of that indescribable, irresistible
thrill which they had always felt, and would
continue to feel to the end of time—their time.</p>

<p>Their opponents were the Terriers, an organization
of scrappy players who had fairly won
their name. The fans got the worth of their
money in a snappy game which was not decided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
till the ninth inning, and then only by an infielder’s
error, which let in the single tally made that day.</p>

<p>The second game was lost by the Hornets; but
they made up for it by having a streak of hitting
in the third contest, and hammering out six runs
to their opponents two.</p>

<p>It was during this last game that Brennan
tried out his cub pitcher, Bert Elgin, for a couple
of innings, and was so pleased with the showing
made by the youngster that he determined to put
him on the slab two days hence when they met the
Blue Stockings for the first time that season.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take a chance with him, and do
the unusual thing,” the manager confided to Jack
Stillman while talking it over afterwards, as he
had a way of doing with this particular reporter.
“I need a youngster to work now and then until
the old men get their wings well oiled up, and I’ve
<em>got</em> to take the chance. I’m banking on Elgin.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” muttered Stillman.</p>

<p>The manager detected the doubt in Stillman’s
mind. “You’ll have to allow that he’s shown
form and class for a youngster.”</p>

<p>The newspaper man shrugged his shoulders.
“I’ll admit that, all right,” he returned. “Still,
that doesn’t prove him Cy Russell’s equal, for
instance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“Did I say he was? All the same, I wouldn’t be
surprised if he pushed Cy pretty hard one of these
days. What you got against him, anyhow? He’s
speedy, and he’s got a fine change of pace. He’s
brainy, too, that boy.”</p>

<p>Stillman raised his eyebrows. “Well?” he
drawled.</p>

<p>“Well, what?” retorted Brennan. “What more
do you want than speed, and control, and brains?”</p>

<p>“Sand,” the reporter said succinctly.</p>

<p>The manager laughed. “I ain’t seen any signs
of his lacking grit. He was up against some proposition
to-day, too, and he pulled out. I guess I
ain’t making any mistake trying him out against
the Blue Stockings. He’s as good as any of Jack
Kennedy’s string of cripples. He ain’t made of
the same stuff as that quitter, Locke, I fired in
Ashland.”</p>

<p>A faint touch of color tinged Stillman’s face.</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Brennan,” he said briefly.
“There’s no comparison between them. Well
we’ll see how he pans out on Saturday.”</p>

<p>As he turned away, a frown wrinkled his smooth
forehead. He was thinking of Lefty, and wishing
fervently that he might be there. What a chance
it would have been! There wasn’t a question that,
if he had remained with the Hornets, Locke might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
have had the opportunity which had been given
to Elgin. Stillman knew baseball, and there was
no shadowy doubt in his mind as to which of the
two was the better man. He felt that Brennan
could not have failed to see it, too, if he had not
been tricked into turning the southpaw away.</p>

<p>However, that was all over and done with. Not
only had Locke been fired, but at this moment
Stillman had not the least idea where his friend
was. He had heard nothing from him since the
day they parted at the Ashland station. The
pitcher had promised to write when he made good,
but he had not written.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s working for some fourth-rate bush
league,” Stillman thought regretfully. “I can’t
say I blame him for not wanting us to know.
Maybe he hasn’t got any job yet. I’d give a farm
to get that crook Elgin where I want him, and
show Brennan what a mistake he’s made.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the ex-sergeant at Ashland had,
so far, failed signally in finding a single clew to the
mystery, and Stillman was beginning to grow discouraged.
It looked as if Bert Elgin had won out,
in spite of the fact that truth and honor and
decency were all opposed to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br>
<small>THE TWO MANAGERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A door opened, and a tall, thin man, with
a slight stoop, stood on the threshold,
looking down upon the manager of the
Hornets. His dark eyes glimmered and a smile
stretched his wide mouth, which transformed the
almost homely face into one that was positively
good-looking.</p>

<p>At the sight of him, Jim Brennan sprang up
from his desk so hurriedly that he came near upsetting
the revolving chair, and leaped toward the
newcomer with hand outstretched.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he exclaimed. “Put it there,
Ken, old boy! It sure does a man good to see your
smiling face again. How’s things?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” returned Kennedy, of the Blue Stockings,
gripping the other’s hand. “Couldn’t be
better, in fact. You’re looking blooming yourself,
Jim. Taken on a few pounds over the winter,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“A few, maybe. I can stand it, though. Once
fat, a little more never cuts any ice. Sit down and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
rest your face and hands. I see you’ve had a
clean sweep so far.”</p>

<p>Kennedy dropped into a chair beside the desk,
crossing one long leg over the other. Though antagonists
on the diamond, in private life the two
men were the best of friends, and always enjoyed
talking things over in this way whenever they
met.</p>

<p>“We have,” rejoined the taller man when Brennan
had settled himself at the desk again, “won
four games straight, which isn’t so bad to start in
the season with.”</p>

<p>Brennan grinned. “Well, you’re up against a
team of real ball players to-day, Ken,” he
chuckled. “Doing some stunts with a bunch of
has-beens on the firing line. I’ve a sort of hunch
that we’re going to break up that streak of luck.”</p>

<p>“I should worry,” smiled Kennedy. “I’ve
never seen the men in better shape. We’re going
to make ’em all take our dust this year.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Brennan. “That remains
to be seen. Who you going to dish up for us to
knock the stuffing out of—Pete Grist?”</p>

<p>“Nope. I’ve got a man I had farmed out to a
Southern independent team, with a string attached.
He turned out to be a regular bush wonder, so I
pulled the string the other day, and yanked him in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
here to try him out on you. It’s always best to
give a youngster something easy to start with.”</p>

<p>Brennan laughed. “Say, Ken, that’s sort of
funny, though. I was counting on putting in a
dark horse myself. He’s a kid I picked up last
fall. I’ll guarantee right now that he’ll lick the
pants off your Southern wonder.”</p>

<p>“If it wasn’t so much like highway robbery, I’d
make you back your talk up with cash,” Kennedy
returned calmly. “As it is, I’ll have to content
myself with a sight of your face after the game.”</p>

<p>Brennan was scoffing at Kennedy’s folly in
imagining he could take a fall out of the Hornets
with a raw busher on the slab, when suddenly he
stopped abruptly, frowning.</p>

<p>“Say!” he burst out the next moment. “Did
a fellow named Locke come around for a job within
the last month? I meant to drop you a line about
him, but I’ll be hanged if I didn’t forget it. He’s
a southpaw, and I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if
he applied under another name.”</p>

<p>Kennedy shook his head. “No, he didn’t
change his name. He couldn’t, seeing as I knew
about him before. He blew in the day before we
broke camp in Georgia; but I was a bit wary when
I found out you’d dropped him that way. He
didn’t stay long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you didn’t get stuck with him,”
Brennan exclaimed emphatically. “I’d sort of
felt it was my fault if you had, seeing as I forgot
to put you wise about him. Believe me, Ken, he
isn’t any use, but he shows up good at first. It
took me the whole training season to get on to the
fact that he’s yellow right through—one of the
worst quitters I ever saw. We’re both well rid of
him. Say, look at the time! I didn’t think it was
so late.”</p>

<p>He sprang up as he spoke, and slammed his desk
down. Kennedy arose more leisurely, and together
they left the office for the dressing rooms of
their respective teams.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX<br>
<small>THE MEETING IN THE GRANDSTAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Three games had been insufficient to take
the edge from the enthusiasm of the fans,
intoxicated with the wine of spring and
bubbling with the joy of looking down once more
upon that diamond after their long winter deprivation.</p>

<p>Moreover, in point of strength there was no
comparison between the Blue Stockings and the
Terriers. To be sure, the latter had made a hot
start this year, but the former were old rivals of
the Hornets, who, year after year, had pushed
them close in that desperate fight for the pennant,
and last season had beaten them out by a hair.
Consequently this first struggle between them
drew almost as many spectators as the game which
had opened the season a week before.</p>

<p>The day was perfect. A sweep of blue sky,
clear save for a few wispy clouds, was overhead.
A trifling little breeze lurked here and
there at sharp turns or corners, but it blew from
the south, and held no chill undercurrent which
was not offset by the warm, grateful sunshine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>The fans rejoiced as they sped toward the
grounds by every possible car line and conveyance.
Those of them who had witnessed the opening
game told one another how much better this one
was likely to be.</p>

<p>Long before one o’clock great throngs had assembled
at the gates, and when those gates were
finally opened there was a wild rush past ticket-takers
into the clattering emptiness of the vast
stands. Down over the tiers of seats they
stumbled, struggling for the desirable front rows.
Hats were smashed here and there, and there were
occasional wordy altercations; but, as a rule,
laughter and joshing and good-natured horseplay
prevailed.</p>

<p>By two o’clock, the bleachers were crowded, and
the more expensive seats were filling fast. Half
an hour later it looked as if every place, save in
the reserved sections, was occupied; and still the
crowd streamed in like a swollen river.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp, tramp! Regular, rhythmic, the
sound of their marching was like the thunder of a
great army. Ogden Wilmerding, hurrying toward
a coveted place in the lower stand, felt the thrill
which that sound brings to the heart of every fan
who has hibernated reluctantly for six long
months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing like it,” he chuckled as he was swept
along. “This looks a lot like opening day,” he
went on, peering over the top of the last row of
seats. “I’m not so sorry as I was over getting
back too late for that.”</p>

<p>He soon saw that it would be impossible to get
the seat he wanted. The section directly behind
the plate was filled in solid. For a moment he
stood there peering down at the reporters’ bench
in a vain hope that some one he knew—Jack Stillman,
perhaps—might find room for him there.
He saw places enough; but neither Stillman nor
any other of his newspaper friends had yet appeared.</p>

<p>“Hang it all!” he muttered. “Why didn’t I
start half an hour earlier, or wire from Boston
for a box?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re the same lazy old slob you were
three years ago,” chuckled a voice in his ear.</p>

<p>Wilmerding whirled, his eyes popping, stared
for a second in speechless amazement at the young
man against whose shoulder he had been almost
leaning. Then he fell upon him with a roar of
delight.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” he gurgled. “Snow,
you old cut-up, where in time have you been? I
thought you’d croaked years ago. Shove along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
and give me a chance. You’re spread over two
seats, easy.”</p>

<p>Snowden Pell obeyed laughingly. The man beside
him, taking in the situation with a good-natured
grin, likewise moved, and Wilmerding was
accommodated with a seat.</p>

<p>“It takes a lot to put me out of business,” Pell
chuckled when his friend had settled beside him.
“I’m very far from being a dead one, as they’ll tell
you out in Seattle.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you write and let somebody
know how you were getting on? Last I heard,
your father failed, or something, and you slipped
out of Princeton right in the middle of the spring
term without saying a word to anybody. To this
day I never knew how much of the tale was truth
and how much fiction.”</p>

<p>“It was pretty much all truth,” Pell returned
quickly. “My governor’s partner got playing the
Wall Street game, and smashed the business to
bits. There wasn’t enough left even for me to
keep on and finish the term, and when I found out
how bad things were I just faded quietly away. I
didn’t want any of the boys to be sorry for me, or
to think that I was an object of charity, the way—”</p>

<p>“Rot!” broke in the stout chap emphatically.
“You make me sick! At least, you might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
said a word to your old friends. Look over in the
bleachers. They’re firing one of those sandwich-chewing-gum-cigar
baskets at each other. Next
thing you know they’ll be tossing some kid
around.”</p>

<p>For a moment they watched the wicker basket
rise and fall as the bleacherites employed their
time in playing a sort of handball with it. Here
and there in a distant part of the stand men were
throwing paper at one another, sporting with the
inevitable straw hat which some one always seems
to bring along for the purpose, and otherwise enjoying
themselves.</p>

<p>Presently Wilmerding turned again to his
friend.</p>

<p>“Well, where’d you go?” he asked. “What
you been doing ever since?”</p>

<p>“I had a job offered me in Seattle, which I
snapped up. It was a good opening for me, and
I’m certainly glad I got with that particular concern,
even if I had to borrow money to get out
there. I had the first letter from them the very
day I left Princeton; and, by Jove, Oggie!”—he
threw back his head and laughed at the sudden
recollection—“you came mighty near being the
goat.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” the stout fellow inquired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
tartly. “You didn’t touch me, that I remember.
Of course, I’d have turned you down”—his tone
was one of heavy sarcasm—“but at least I’d liked
to have had the chance.”</p>

<p>“You were the first person I thought of when
I realized I’d have to sting somebody,” Pell
laughed. “Trouble was, I couldn’t locate you.
Went to your room, and stayed a deuce of a while
in hopes you’d come in. Then, when I couldn’t
wait any longer, I hunted up Victor Wood, and
he did the business.”</p>

<p>He hesitated an instant, and then went on
swiftly, a note of sudden curiosity in his voice:</p>

<p>“That reminds me of something I’ve always
wanted to ask you. What sort of a game did you
and Bert Elgin have together about that time?”</p>

<p>Wilmerding stared. “Game?” he repeated
blankly. “Bert Elgin? I don’t get you, Snow.
Elucidate.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought it was a joke of some kind,”
Pell returned. “Only it seemed funny that all of a
sudden you should be as chummy as that with
Elgin. While I was waiting for you, I strolled into
your bedroom to brush my hair. I was standing
before the bureau when I heard the outside door
open. Thought it was you, of course, until some
one called out your name. I didn’t feel in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
mood for gassing with any one else, so I said
nothing and slipped back to one side of the door.</p>

<p>“To make a long story short, I heard the fellow
moving around the sitting room, and pretty soon
I happened to catch sight of him in the dressing-table
mirror. It was Bert Elgin, and he was heading
for the bookshelves in the corner.”</p>

<p>Wilmerding gave a slight start, the color flaming
into his face.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he urged, as his friend, glancing at
him, paused in his narration. “What—happened?”</p>

<p>“He took something out of his pocket and
dropped it behind the books,” Pell continued. “I
didn’t see what it was; but as it fell there was a
clink that sounded like metal—a chain or——
Great Scott! What is it, Oggie? What’s the
matter with you?”</p>

<p>The color had vanished from Wilmerding’s face,
and he was staring at his companion with a
strained, incredulous expression in his eyes which
testified to the emotion he was undergoing.</p>

<p>“What—books—were they?” he gasped at
length, in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“The books he put the stuff behind, you mean?”
queried Pell. “I don’t remember, but I think it
was the second shelf from the top. I know they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
were over on the extreme right-hand end of the
case.”</p>

<p>Wilmerding drew his breath with a whistling
sound. For an instant he sat silent. Then he
moved his hand unconsciously, and caught Pell’s
arm in a grip which made the man wince.</p>

<p>“What day was that, Snow?” he breathed.</p>

<p>“The twenty-sixth of May,” was the quick response.
“I don’t think I’ll ever forget that date.
It was about three in the afternoon. But what in
thunder was it all about, Oggie? I never supposed
it was anything but a joke. Can’t you put a fellow
wise?”</p>

<p>The big man at his side did not answer. He
was staring out across the diamond toward the
bleachers, black with their crowds of restless fans.
He saw nothing, heard nothing. He could not
speak for the joy which filled his soul as a realization
of the truth came to him at last.</p>

<p>He was not a thief!</p>

<p>For years he had been so absolutely convinced
that it was he who had—unconsciously, perhaps,
but still none the less certainly—stolen those
things from Bob Ferris’ rooms, that Pell’s story
struck him as almost incredible.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake, however. The details
fitted too perfectly to admit of a coincidence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
Lefty had been right, it was Elgin who was the
thief, not he. And Elgin it was who had done a
thing which would have been impossible in Wilmerding,
waking or sleeping; he had deliberately
stolen, and as deliberately planned to throw the
blame upon an innocent man.</p>

<p>Sudden, furious anger flamed up within the
Princeton man. He felt as if he must search out
that contemptible coward and give him a little of
what was coming to him. He half rose from the
bench, his face livid; and then he realized that all
around him a wild uproar had arisen. Men yelled
and cheered themselves purple; they stamped and
shouted and waved their hats.</p>

<p>Pell’s hand caught Wilmerding by the arm and
dragged him down, but not before the angry man
had caught a glimpse of the line of athletes in
their immaculate uniforms, leaving the shadow of
the distant bleachers and trotting briskly into the
brilliant April sunshine on the field.</p>

<small>THE SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Amid the roaring of the crowd, the Hornets
made their way across the diamond.
Brennan was in the lead, with Cy Russell
beside him; and, at moments when the scurrying
phalanx of photographers permitted, the manager
talked to his star pitcher in low tones.</p>

<p>“You’d better keep your arm limbered, Cy,” he
said. “I shall send you in if they get to Elgin.
The gink Kennedy’s going to open with ought to
be soft for us.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Russell asked curiously.</p>

<p>The manager paused until a camera had been
snapped and the reporter had retreated to a little
distance.</p>

<p>“Some busher,” he explained. “Ken seems to
think he’s a find, but I’ve seen them kind before.
Grist’ll take his place when we bat him out, and we
want to get away to a flying start.”</p>

<p>As they neared the bench, the fans gave a yell
for Russell, and several newspaper men came up
to inquire perfunctorily whether it was not true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
that he was to go on the slab first for the Hornets.</p>

<p>“You boys’ll find that out in time,” Brennan returned
evasively. “Don’t you know that I ain’t
the kind to give out that information before the
announcer? Chase yourselves.”</p>

<p>He turned to Bert Elgin, who was standing not
far away, looking as cool and nonchalant as if he
had never played on anything but a Big League
team, and proceeded to give him a few last bits of
advice.</p>

<p>While this was going on, another cheer went up
from the stands as the Blue Stockings’ contingent
appeared and rapidly crossed the field.</p>

<p>Brennan’s back was towards them, and he was
consequently surprised to see Elgin give a sudden
start and stare fixedly at the approaching squad.</p>

<p>For an instant Elgin’s face remained fixed; then
into his eyes there leaped an expression of such
utter astonishment, mingled with hate, that the
manager’s words ceased abruptly, and he grasped
the young pitcher by one arm.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>Elgin swallowed hard, and his face, which had
turned slightly pale, now flamed crimson.</p>

<p>“Look there!” he said hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>Brennan whirled and stared at the approaching
players. For a second he saw only the line of
blue-stockinged men, headed by Jack Kennedy.
Then, as his eyes focused on the tall, lithe, graceful
figure walking beside Spider Grant, the famous
first baseman of the rival organization, his jaw
dropped.</p>

<p>“I’ll—be—hanged!” he gasped. “Tom Locke!”</p>

<p>It was Lefty, browner than he had been a month
ago, and with, if possible, an easier swing in his
carriage. His face glowed with health. His teeth
gleamed as he smiled at some sally of his companion.
He showed no trace of the awkwardness or
embarrassment which one might naturally expect
at his first encounter with the team from which he
had been dropped in such disgrace. True, his
brown eyes flashed a single questioning glance at
one man among the Hornets, but it was seen by no
one save that man, who leaped forward as if propelled
from a catapult.</p>

<p>“Lefty, you old lobster!” he cried, as he gripped
both of the southpaw’s hands in his. “What you
deserve is a good larruping; and I’d like to hand
it to you right now.”</p>

<p>There was an odd expression on Lefty’s face as
he grasped Fargo’s big fists firmly. For an instant
he did not speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t make good, Buck—honest I didn’t,”
he said at length in a low tone.</p>

<p>“G’wan!” retorted the backstop. “What you
giving us? Ain’t you with the Blue Stockings?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I’ve been with them only two days.
Kennedy farmed me with the Badgers, down
South. I never knew what he thought of me, or
what he meant to do, till I got a wire telling me to
come on at once. I had a streak of great luck down
there, and I suppose—”</p>

<p>“Luck be hanged!” interrupted Fargo forcibly.
“You made good, just as you would have with us
if that miserable sneak— Say! You ain’t going
into the game to-day?”</p>

<p>Locke hesitated an instant, and then nodded.
“Yes,” he said, lowering his voice. “Kennedy’s
going to give me a chance.”</p>

<p>Fargo grinned. “Glory be! The old man’s going
to put Elgin on the slab. You’ll be up against
him at last; and, if you don’t make him look like
a rotten lemon, it’s all up between you and me.”</p>

<p>For a second Locke stood looking at his friend,
with sparkling eyes and swiftly reddening cheeks.
His face took on a look of firm, indomitable purpose.
Unconsciously both brown, muscular hands,
hanging straight down at his sides, clenched themselves
until the knuckles showed white through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
skin. Then he pulled himself together with an effort,
and laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re a hot ball player to talk like that,” he
joshed. “You sure don’t want your own pitcher
to fall down, do you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not keen about losing the game,” Fargo
returned. “But I shouldn’t shed tears if Elgin
was hammered out of the box.”</p>

<p>Up on the reporters’ bench a telegraph instrument
had suddenly ceased clicking, and a rush and
bustle followed as a slim fellow in a long tan coat
and rakish soft hat pushed hurriedly past his fellow
reporters.</p>

<p>He paid no heed to their comments and questions,
but, reaching one of the gates, thrust it open,
and hastened out upon the field. A moment later
he, too, was shaking hands with Lefty and upbraiding
him in unmeasured terms.</p>

<p>Presently several more of the Hornets’ players
strolled up and joined the little group about the
young twirler. The fans, realizing that something
was doing which they did not understand,
gave vent to caustic comments and various sarcastic
remarks about the folly of delaying the game.</p>

<p>Brennan, still scowling, called peremptorily to
his men, and sent them loping on to the diamond
for preliminary practice. Locke took a position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
over to one side, and commenced warming up.
The field was soon a picture of animated motion.</p>

<p>“What kind of a game is this you’re giving me,
Ken?” Brennan inquired tartly as Kennedy
strolled up a moment later. “You told me you’d
thrown down that fellow Locke when he applied
for a job.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t, Jim,” retorted the Blue Stockings’
manager mildly, a faint twinkle in his dark
eyes. “I said he didn’t stay with me long. He
didn’t. I let the Badgers have him. Hadn’t time
to bother with him myself, so I shipped him to
them for a try-out, with one of my scouts to keep
an eye on him. The boy won every game he
pitched, and did such brainy work that I pulled
him in. The reason I didn’t tell you his name was
because he asked me this morning not to say anything
about him to any of your crowd.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” growled Brennan. “Thought he
was goin’ to jar me, I suppose. So this is the bush
wonder you were telling me about. I wish you
joy with that quitter. Better have an anchor
ready to hitch to him about the third inning.
You’ll need it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see if you’re right,” smiled Kennedy.</p>

<p>Brennan turned away, grumbling incoherently.
Evidently he was still feeling somewhat sore.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
The gingery fielding practice continued to the delight
of the spectators, who applauded every
snappy throw or pretty catch.</p>

<p>When the Blue Stockings took their places on
the diamond their efforts were cheered almost as
much as had been those of the home team. The
great crowd seemed to be in a jovial, good-natured
mood; though, when the practice was over and the
batteries for the day announced, there was a concerted
growl at the discovery that two unknowns
were to take the slab instead of the old favorites.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was no great amount of
kicking. The game was about to begin; that was
the main thing. Besides, it would be rather interesting
to see which of these cubs proved himself
the better man.</p>

<p>The photographers were shooed away and the
field cleared. The Hornets pranced out upon the
diamond like a lot of colts, eager for the fray.
Elgin got a cheer all to himself for the cool, confident,
and business-like way in which he took the
slab. The umpires got into position, one of them
tossing out a clean, new ball to the young pitcher.
The fans yelled again, just for the sake of letting
off steam.</p>

<p>Then came a tense, breathless hush as they
waited for the first ball to be pitched.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI<br>
<small>THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Rufe Hyland, the visitors’ right fielder
and one of their crack hitters, stood at
the pan, calm and smiling, swinging his
stick with a short, gentle motion, which seemed to
denote tense muscles and a brain alert and ready
to take advantage of any pitched ball that should
nick the platter.</p>

<p>In spite of his seeming coolness, Bert Elgin had
really never been more nervous in his life. He
took his time, even after Fargo had given the signal,
and, as he dug away the soil near the pitcher’s
rubber with his copper toe, he heard his teammates
coaching behind him.</p>

<p>He was heartened by the sound of their friendly
voices; but, nevertheless, the straight, low one he
sent over seemed to lack his usual cannon-ball
speed. Hyland lashed it out in a manner which
sent the pitcher’s heart down into his boots. For
an instant he thought it a two-bagger, at least.
Then, as he whirled round, he saw that Dutch
Siegrist, sprinting at full speed, had scooped it
right off the blades of grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>The superb catch brought a yell of delight from
the Hornets’ rooters, and seemed to brace Elgin
amazingly. He took a long breath, and his nerves
ceased to flutter as he surveyed the next batter.
He felt a new confidence in himself in the realization
that the team was behind him, ready to back
him up with their wonderfully perfect organization.
He lost instantly that sense of isolation he
had been conscious of at first—the feeling that
the entire weight and responsibility of the game
lay on his shoulders. The boys were there, ready
to cover any blunder or mistake he might make;
and, though this did not bring about laxness in
his pitching, it was infinitely consoling.</p>

<p>Again he took the signal from the big backstop,
but this time the ball he put over had burning
speed, and a little jump to it which completely
fooled Pink Dalton, the Blue Stockings’ second
baseman.</p>

<p>It was followed by an incurve that cut the corner
of the plate.</p>

<p>Dalton fouled back of the pan.</p>

<p>Then came a couple of teasers which the batter
ignored; and finally, with two and two, the Blue
Stockings’ man hoisted a high fly into left field,
which was easily caught by the guardian of that
pasture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>The roaring approval of the crowd caused the
blood to tingle in Elgin’s veins. Before the end
of the game he meant to have them shouting his
name as loudly as they had yelled for Russell, or
Pop Jennings, or any other of the old favorites,
on the opening day. It wasn’t such a hard matter,
after all, to pitch in a Big League contest.</p>

<p>By carefully following Fargo’s signals, he struck
out Brock, the visitors’ center fielder, and then
walked toward the bench with a little, unconscious
swagger. One or two of his fellow players told
him how well he’d done. Brennan, even, added
his approval.</p>

<p>Elgin fancied that he had made a very good
start, indeed, and that there wasn’t a doubt of his
form improving as the game progressed. He was
quite satisfied with his cleverness in letting only
three batters oppose him. He gave no thought to
how much the man behind the pan had contributed
to this result. Neither he nor any one else had the
least conception of the fight which had gone on in
Buck Fargo’s mind between loyalty to his team
and the contempt and hatred he felt for the pitcher
his brains and experience were helping so greatly.</p>

<p>The caustic comment and jeering criticism which
had greeted Elgin’s appearance were as nothing to
the disparaging chorus that arose when Lefty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
walked out into the diamond. Baseball fans are
extremely partizan, and the supporters of the Hornets
outnumbered those of their opponents ten to
one.</p>

<p>The southpaw could not help being a bit affected
by the unflattering remarks hurled at him from
the bleachers and grandstand, even though he
knew how little such things counted and how fickle
the average rooter is. He felt, too, and rather
painfully, the lack of encouragement from his own
team. He knew he was not one of them. They
had shown him that only too plainly. With the
exception of one or two, they had made him perfectly
aware of the fact that they regarded him
as a man who had yet to win his spurs, and on
whom the honor of opening the first game with the
Hornets had devolved more by accident, or through
a whim of their manager, than from any real worth
or proven merit. Their silence as he toed the
slab was in vivid contrast to the behavior of their
opponents in the first half of the inning.</p>

<p>It made him set his teeth and resolve desperately
to make good; to show them that he had
something in him; to vindicate Jack Kennedy’s
judgment; incidentally, to prove to the latter how
grateful he was for having been given this chance.</p>

<p>For a second he waited for his catcher’s signal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
but none came. Dirk Nelson seemed to be occupied
in settling down behind the pan and making
sure that his mitt was in place. Lefty wondered
whether the backstop’s well-known chumminess
with Pete Grist, the popular Blue Stockings’
twirler, had anything to do with this unusual state
of absent-mindedness. Grist had shown unmistakable
signs of ill humor on discovering that he
was not to start on the slab to-day.</p>

<p>There was but a momentary hesitation. Bill
Hagin was at bat, and Lefty had played too many
practice games against the capable outfielder not
to know pretty well his strong and weak points.
Unfortunately the latter were few. The southpaw
was satisfied, however, when he finally got Nelson’s
belated signal. A slow floater was what he handed
up for a starter.</p>

<p>Hagin, doting on speed, could not restrain himself,
and struck too soon. Lefty then tried a
curve. The batter swung at it, making connections
and bumping a slow grounder towards short.</p>

<p>Eddie Lewis made the mistake of waiting for the
ball, and was then forced to throw hastily in order
to get it across the diamond in time. That hasty
throw was wide, and Spider Grant had to leap off
the cushion. Hagin was safe because of bad judgment
and an error.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>The crowd cheered, and urged Dutch Siegrist to
carry on the good work.</p>

<p>The first baseman of the Hornets took no
chances. In spite of Lefty’s efforts to prevent it,
he managed to lay down a bunt which corkscrewed
along the base line, ever threatening to roll foul,
but in the end coming to rest a couple of inches
on the right side. Locke snatched it up and lined
it to Grant, but the delay had made it possible for
the German to reach the sack in safety.</p>

<p>Jim Brennan smiled significantly. He had
watched Locke closely and expectantly, waiting
for signs of the yellow streak to show. With two
men on bases and none out, it looked very much as
if the southpaw’s first inning would be his last.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him going,” the manager of the
Hornets muttered jubilantly. “Ken’ll have to
yank him sudden. I reckon he’ll have more faith
in my judgment after this.”</p>

<p>When Nolan, his left fielder, presently sent a
foul back of first and was put out by Grant’s
wonderful sprinting and equally amazing catch,
Brennan’s conviction was in no wise altered.
This was pure luck, helped on by the skill of the
first baseman, and reflected no credit on Locke.</p>

<p>Buck Fargo was advancing to the plate, too,
which boded well for the Hornets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>“You know what to do, Buck,” the manager
said, in a low tone, as the backstop passed him.
“We’ve got this green portsider on the run already.”</p>

<p>It was a curious situation. The two men facing
each other were friends. Fargo’s sympathy for
the young pitcher was such that he wanted him to
make good almost more than he desired a victory
for his own team. The big backstop could help
very materially, if he wished, without any risk to
himself; and he realized that this was a crucial
moment in the inning when a hit might mean a run,
while an out would go far toward killing the Hornet’s
chances for scoring.</p>

<p>To his honor, he walked to the pan with the fixed
determination to forget that Lefty was pitching,
and to give his manager the very best that was in
him.</p>

<p>And now Locke realized that the thing which
had hitherto been in his favor was going to work
the other way. If he knew intimately the likes
and dislikes, the batting strength and weakness of
each member of the opposing team, the man who
faced him now was in a position to know quite
as much, or more, about himself.</p>

<p>Lefty’s face was a shade less brown as he toed
the rubber, but his nerves were quite steady, his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
courage unabated. He would do his best; no man
could do more.</p>

<p>The cheering and comments in the stands had
ceased. Even the murmur of voices died away
as the spectators bent forward in breathless suspense.</p>

<p>The first one was not over, and Fargo refused
to go after it.</p>

<p>“Ba-a-ll!” drawled the umpire.</p>

<p>“He’ll put it over now,” thought Fargo, swinging
his stick gently. He had ceased to think of
Lefty as his friend; he was now simply the pitcher
of the rival team.</p>

<p>He was mistaken, however. Though it seemed
to be Locke’s intention to cut the pan, Fargo saw
the ball break for a curve which would carry it
just outside, and again he refrained from swinging.</p>

<p>“Two-oo!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>In the silence of the breathless crowd some one
was heard to say:</p>

<p>“He’s afraid of him. He don’t dare let him
hit it.”</p>

<p>These words did not reach the southpaw’s ears.
The latter, however, had no intention of pitching
himself into a hole if he could help it. He bent
over a sizzler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>Fargo swung and missed, although he almost
fancied that he felt the bat lightly touch the whistling
ball. A murmur rose from the Blue Stockings’
rooters.</p>

<p>A moment later, Lefty shot the ball back with a
quick return, and, though he was not taken off his
guard, the batter missed again.</p>

<p>The murmur rose.</p>

<p>Then Locke tried that slow, lingering ball which
he could so cleverly deliver after going through
movements which seemed to promise great speed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Fargo had seen him try that same
trick more than once, and he refused to be fooled.
Watching the horsehide as it came up and dropped
toward the ground, he let it settle into the catcher’s
hands without having moved his stick.</p>

<p>The Hornets’ fans had a chance to yell, but
their uproar was swiftly cut short. Now was the
moment of greatest suspense. The next ball delivered
would be decisive.</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity, but which was,
in reality, the briefest sort of pause, the southpaw
pitched.</p>

<p>Fargo met the sphere on the trademark and
sent it humming out on a line with the speed of a
bullet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII<br>
<small>THE TRUTH AT LAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Like a flash, thousands of fans were on
their feet. The roar which reverberated
back and forth in the great inclosure was
enough to shake the row of eagles ornamenting the
roof of the grandstand. Hagin was off like a
rocket. Siegrist was not far behind. Fargo himself
showed that backstopping was not his only
strong point.</p>

<p>As for Lefty, after that first awful moment of
sinking which had followed the fatal crack of
leather meeting wood, he brought himself together
with a jerk, and whirled round.</p>

<p>Rufe Hyland, in right field, had not wasted an
instant. Covering the ground with tremendous
strides, he scooped the ball cleanly, spun around,
and threw even while still in motion. It was
meant to be a straight throw to the plate, but in a
second Lefty saw that the fielder’s forced turn
had lost him every particle of body motion which
might have helped out his arm, and knew the
sphere would fall short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>Like a flash, the southpaw darted to one side,
leaped into the air, and forked the ball with one
hand. As he did so, Hagin, running like a racehorse,
flung himself feet foremost to the ground,
and slid over the plate.</p>

<p>Siegrist had raced down to second, and crossed
the sack at full speed. When he saw Lefty intercept
the ball and whirl toward third, he sought to
turn back. Locke whipped the sphere straight
into the hands of Pink Dalton, who was covering
the second anchorage; and the latter, after jabbing
it on to the lunging German, snapped it to first
with a lightninglike motion, not even taking the
time to straighten up.</p>

<p>It was one of the most surprising double plays
ever seen on the New Grounds. Fargo, having
rounded the sack and seen the ball speeding apparently
toward the plate, naturally did not halt
until he was nearly halfway to the second hassock.
Even then he might have got back safely had it
not been for the extraordinary accuracy of Dalton’s
throw. As it was, the finish of the play was
close. The keen-eyed umpire declared Fargo out.</p>

<p>The applause of the Hornets’ rooters suddenly
ceased. It was followed by the cheers of their
rivals. The home team had made a run, to be
sure, but this abrupt and unexpected ending of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
inning rather took the wind out of their sails.
They gave vent to their annoyance by heaping
abuse on the umpire.</p>

<p>As Lefty walked to the bench his eyes sought
the face of his manager questioningly. He felt no
doubt that only for the success of this last play he
would have been taken out of the game at once.
Only one hit had been made off him, to be sure,
but he knew that a pitcher is frequently removed
when the game is going wrong through no fault
of his own. Jack Kennedy showed no such intention,
however.</p>

<p>“That was a heady play of yours, Lefty,” he
said. “I saw the ball would fall short the minute
it left Hyland’s hand. If you hadn’t had your
thinker working, we’d likely have had more than
one tally to buck against.”</p>

<p>“It was Dalton who put a kibosh on them,”
Locke returned. “That was some throw of his
to first.”</p>

<p>“Sure. But you used your nut and made it
possible. One minute, Grant. You’d better—”</p>

<p>His voice dropped to a whisper, and Lefty
walked away, his face slightly flushed, his eyes
bright. Jack Kennedy was a manager who never
hesitated about blowing up his men, and he could
do it in a cutting, caustic manner much more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
thorough than mere loud-mouthed ranting. He
had also the much rarer trait of judicious praise,
which was, perhaps, one of the reasons why he
was so popular with his players.</p>

<p>The second inning presented no such spectacular
features as had appeared in its predecessor.
Elgin, cool, confident, and a little cocky, did not
let a man pass second. The fans were beginning
to yell rough pleasantries at him, and reporters
who had been with the Hornets through the spring
training harked back to the prophecies they had
sent home regarding this youngster’s exceptional
ability.</p>

<p>Locke, on the other hand, was touched up for two
singles, and had men on first and third with only
one out. One of these was caught while trying to
steal second, and put out by Nelson’s beautiful
throwing. The other was cantering toward the
home plate, with the full expectation of scoring,
when he discovered that the southpaw had reached
forth a bare hand and plucked the batted ball out
of the air, thus spoiling a base hit and ending the
inning.</p>

<p>“Great work,” chuckled Jack Stillman, up at
the reporters’ table, as he reached for his tobacco
pouch.</p>

<p>“Great luck, I should say,” retorted the newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
man next to him. “Looks to me like a
fine case of horseshoes.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about that,” put in the sporting
editor of the <cite>Blade</cite>, who sat on Stillman’s
other side. “The boy seems to have a little gray
matter, and there’s a bulldog expression about his
mouth and chin which makes me think he’ll stand
the pace longer than this Elgin, who’s beginning
to strut a little already. You saw quite a little of
him down at Ashland, didn’t you, Jack?”</p>

<p>Stillman did not answer. With the leather
pouch, he had pulled from his pocket a crumpled
envelope bearing the postmark of that very Texas
town. For a second he stared at it in a puzzled
way. Then he remembered. The hotel clerk had
handed it to him just as he was leaving for the
game with a bunch of fellows, and he had put it
aside, intending to read it later, only to forget
its existence completely.</p>

<p>With a swift jerk of one finger, he tore the envelope
open. There was a long letter in the
cramped, laborious handwriting of William Bowers,
the ex-sergeant, but that was not what his
eyes were fixed on with such curious intentness.
He had received many of those letters in the past
month, and all to no purpose. What he had never
had before was this inclosure, an affidavit bearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
the seal of a notary public and signed by one
Edward Black, and several witnesses.</p>

<p>With a swift-drawn breath, Stillman fairly
raced through the document, his face flushing, his
eyes snapping, an expression of the most intense
satisfaction swiftly overspreading his countenance.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he breathed, when he had finished.
“He’s got him at last! I knew that cur Elgin was
responsible, and this proves it.”</p>

<p>He half rose from his seat, only to drop back
into it again as he realized the impossibility of
reaching Brennan now.</p>

<p>“Afterward will do as well,” he muttered. “If
this doesn’t blow the scoundrel clean out of water,
I’m a lobster!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII<br>
<small>THE LUCKY SEVENTH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Unconscious of the gathering storm,
Bert Elgin continued his fine work. Inning
after inning he held the visitors
down, rising to his highest pitch of excellence in
the fifth by striking out the opposing batters in
one, two, three order.</p>

<p>His rival was equally successful so far as results
went, but his methods were not as spectacular.
He seemed not to exert himself until forced
to the wall, and then, as likely as not, his manner
of getting out of the hole was such that the bulk of
spectators put it down to luck or the wonderful
support back of him.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, while the metropolitan fans
were howling themselves hoarse with praises for
Elgin, the Blue Stockings’ supporters could never
be quite sure that the southpaw was not on the
verge of “blowing up,” and their rooting was
more for the team as a body than for the man on
the slab.</p>

<p>There were a few in the vast crowd, more observant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
than their neighbors, who realized the
truth. Elgin was clever, to be sure, but little by
little they saw how much of his success on the
mound was due to the knowledge and experience
of his fellow players.</p>

<p>Buck Fargo was a born backstop. Absolutely
perfect in the mechanical side of his position, he
was able to give his whole attention to the batter
and, therefore, seemed to possess, almost uncannily,
the power of sensing the sort of ball which
would be, at any particular moment, most distasteful.
Happily for Elgin, the pitcher had the
sense to follow his catcher’s signals implicitly.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the others of the team were
in thorough sympathy with their pitcher. He had
been one of them from the beginning of the season,
and had deported himself with cleverness that won
the liking of not a few. There were no jealousies
and heartburnings to combat. They were
beginning, also, to feel a certain measure of confidence
in him, and their support was of the
finished Big League sort, plus enthusiasm, which
was a joy to see.</p>

<p>It was quite the contrary with their opponents.
Though they might not realize it, the majority
were still sore at having this busher put on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
slab for such an important game. They had no
confidence in his ability to pull out successfully,
and, though their playing was mechanically perfect,
their support was that of men who are thinking
of themselves and their averages.</p>

<p>During the last of the sixth the Hornets scored
another tally on an error of the opposing shortstop,
and the fans sat back comfortably, assured
that the game was safe.</p>

<p>With the opening of the seventh, there was a
sudden billowing up of the crowd throughout the
entire circle of stands and bleachers. They
stretched themselves and stamped their feet until
the noise was like the deafening rattle of stage
thunder. The visitors, though fearful of defeat,
nevertheless raised the stentorian cry of “Lucky
seventh! Lucky seventh! Here’s where we do
it!”</p>

<p>Eddie Lewis, the Blue Stockings’ shortstop, was
the first man up. Elgin eyed him critically, and,
remembering that he had caught the man with an
inshoot once before, decided to repeat the trick.
He had been growing more and more cocksure as
the game progressed, so, when Fargo called for a
straight, fast high ball, Elgin responded with his
own views on the subject. It was time, he decided,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
that he cut loose from the backstop’s apron-strings.
He had been hitched to them too long
already.</p>

<p>Fargo repeated his signal, but Elgin shook his
head obstinately. Finally he got the signal he
wanted. Lewis stepped swiftly back; there was
a ringing crack; the horsehide whizzed straight at
Elgin, who—ducked!</p>

<p>He had never done such a thing before, but
the total unexpectedness of the hit, and the fact
that the sphere was humming straight at his head
with the speed of a cannon ball, deprived him for
a second of reason, and made his act instinctive.</p>

<p>Lewis got to first easily. The entire Hornets’
infield made various caustic comments. From the
stands the fickle crowd showered insults which
brought the color flaming into Elgin’s face and
made him drop the ball when he received it from
the outfielder.</p>

<p>The incident so disturbed him that he proceeded
to present Nelson with a free pass, which brought
loud cheers from the Blue Stockings’ rooters, and
more unflattering comments from the upholders of
the home team.</p>

<p>“He’s going up! He’s going up!” chanted the
visiting fans, grasping at a straw. “Send him to
the stable! Put the blanket on him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>Elgin gritted his teeth and faced Jack Daly as he
toed the scratch, bland and smiling. Men were
yelling advice to the batter; others flinging taunts
at the man on the mound. The tumult was increasing
steadily. Fargo, catching a glimpse of
Elgin’s face, dropped on one knee and deliberately
adjusted his shoe-lace.</p>

<p>Daly let a wide one pass, and then banged out a
grounder which, but for splendid fielding, would
have been a hit. As it was, Dirk Nelson, forced
from the initial sack, was put out at second by a
hair. Daly reached first safely, and Eddie Lewis
executed an impromptu jig on third.</p>

<p>By this time a perfect pandemonium had broken
forth all over the stands. The visiting rooters,
seeing hope for the first time, seemed trying to
rattle the pitcher, while the fickle metropolitan
fans howled at the unfortunate twirler they had
been cheering so vociferously a short time before.</p>

<p>“Take him out! Take him out!” they bawled.
“Russell! We—want—Cy!”</p>

<p>Amid this turmoil, Lefty Locke approached the
pan, his heart pounding unevenly and his face
glowing dully under the tan. So far he had shown
little ability with the stick; nevertheless, the hopeful
Blue Stockings’ adherents greeted him uproariously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“Kill it, Locke!” was the stentorian cry. “Kill
it, old boy!”</p>

<p>The sound of their voices thrilled the southpaw.
Only an abnormally cold-blooded youngster would
have felt no thrill. It exalted him and made him
confident that he could hit anything Elgin ventured
to whip over.</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause as Fargo hurried
into the diamond and spoke a few reassuring
words to the white-faced twirler.</p>

<p>While he waited, leaning on his stick, Lefty cast
a casual glance along the wide sweep of stands
and boxes crowded with yelling, cheering humanity.
The next instant his heart stood still. He
was staring fixedly at an upper box that was filled
with a gay party of men and women. As Lefty
gazed with unbelieving wonder, a woman suddenly
arose, straight and slim and girlish, her face flushing
and her eyes bright. Smiling down at him, she
waved a tiny handkerchief.</p>

<p>It was Janet Harting!</p>

<p>His face crimson, Lefty pulled off his cap a little
awkwardly. How she happened to be there
he had no idea. Who she was with he did not
know—or care. She was watching him pitch his
first Big League game, watching his trial by fire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
and she believed in him. He toed the slab, believing
more than ever in himself.</p>

<p>Elgin’s face was still pale and set. A moment
before he had caught a glimpse of Brennan talking
earnestly with Cy Russell, after which the pitcher
peeled off his sweater and loped across the turf,
beckoning to the second catcher. It looked as if
the end were in sight.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he ground his teeth and scowled
fiercely at the hated Locke. He must get him—he
must! The words rang dully through the
pitcher’s brain until he wondered whether he was
speaking them aloud. He paused, looking beseechingly
at Fargo, who repeated the signal.</p>

<p>Reluctantly Elgin wound up and pitched.</p>

<p>The southpaw’s bat met the horsehide with a
smash that sent it flying over Nolan’s head toward
the left field bleachers.</p>

<p>With a mingled cry of anguish and joy, the spectators
leaped to their feet and followed the progress
of the flying sphere with straining eyes.
For a moment it looked as if the fielder might get
it by fast sprinting, and Lewis halted an instant on
third, head twisted, gauging the rapidly falling dot
of white.</p>

<p>Then it was seen that Nolan must fail to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
the catch, and the runner was sent home with a
rush, while voices accelerated Daly’s flying progress
from first. The latter rounded second without
a pause just as the fielder made a beautiful
recovery and lined the ball to third. There were
frantic shrieks of “Slide! slide!” which Daly
obeyed without hesitation, skimming over the
ground amid a cloud of dust, to hook the hassock
with his foot as the sphere smacked into Monte
Harris’ mitt.</p>

<p>The latter sent it humming back to second, for
Lefty was coming down the line with the speed
of a racehorse. But he, too, slid safely; and the
breathless stillness was rent by the loud rejoicings
of the great crowd of Blue Stockings’ admirers
who had come over from the neighboring city to
watch their team open against the Hornets.</p>

<p>“Oh, you Locke!” they shrieked fondly.
“What’s the matter with Lefty? He’s—all—right!”</p>

<p>When the thunder of their accompanying stamping
had died away, they turned their attention
to Elgin, calling for airships and the like, until
their voices were drowned by the howls of the disappointed
opposition:</p>

<p>“Take him out! Take him out! Take-him-out!
He’s yellow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>The pitcher, white-faced, beads of perspiration
besprinkling his forehead, stood shifting about
near the slab, with downcast eyes and lips which
trembled in spite of his efforts to steady them.
Once he cast a swift glance toward the manager,
but received no hoped-for sign.</p>

<p>He wanted to be taken out. He was afraid.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV<br>
<small>THE LEADING RUN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Brennan’s reason for not doing at once
the thing which was inevitable was not
quite apparent. He had an obstinate
streak in his make-up, and no doubt it went very
much against the grain to see the man he had depended
on and boasted about fall down so disastrously,
though ordinarily that would have made no
difference.</p>

<p>At any rate, he held his hand, and it cost him
another run. Rufe Hyland landed on the second
ball pitched, and sent out a long fly to right field.
The moment Johnny Burns caught the ball Daly
darted for the plate.</p>

<p>There was a momentary lull in the excitement as
Burns made a great throw to Buck Fargo. Then
the racket broke loose again as Daly slid over the
dish in the nick of time; for Fargo had made a
fruitless sweep of the hand to tag him.</p>

<p>With the score tied and Locke on third, the
visiting fans yelled without interruption as Pink
Dalton came to the plate. Fargo again tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
brace Elgin up, but with poor success; and it was
no credit to the pitcher that Red Pollock scooped
up a red-hot grounder and lined it, sizzling, to the
sack in time to end the inning and prevent further
scoring.</p>

<p>A storm of hoots and catcalls greeted Elgin as
he walked slowly and dejectedly toward the bench.
Brennan said nothing, but the look he cast at the
twirler was more expressive than many spoken
words could have been. Elgin, his face as flaming
now as it had been pale, hurried past him, and
slunk thankfully to the obscurity of the bench.</p>

<p>When Lefty took his place on the slab, a roar of
applause greeted him. He shot a glance at that
upper box, and was even further heartened by
the wave he received in return. His form was
so perfect, and the support of his backers so full
of new life and snap, that he retired the Hornets
without letting a man reach second.</p>

<p>A lull followed. Cy Russell, in splendid shape
and aching to retrieve the blunders made by his
predecessor, easily disposed of the batters who
faced him during the eighth and ninth innings.</p>

<p>Lefty was equally fortunate; and the tenth inning
opened with the spectators on tiptoe with excitement,
and some of them so hoarse they could
scarcely speak above a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>Again it was Eddie Lewis who came up first,
and the sympathizers with the Blue Stockings
seemed to take it as a good omen. All around the
field the visiting rooters were waving hats and
yelling like demons. Russell put the first ball
squarely over for a strike, and followed it with
another. Lewis cracked the third one to left field
for a two-bagger.</p>

<p>With a concerted yell, every fan leaped to his
feet. When Lewis made second safely they
seemed to forget to sit down, so great was their
excitement.</p>

<p>“Lay down a bunt, Dirk,” Kennedy said quietly,
as Nelson came up.</p>

<p>The catcher obeyed the injunction to the letter.
He bunted the ball within two yards of the plate
just as Lewis started for third. Russell was on
the alert and ready, and, rushing swiftly toward
the horsehide, he snatched it up and shot it with
the speed of a bullet into Harris’ hands. Lewis
beat the throw, however, and was called safe, while
Nelson reached first without difficulty.</p>

<p>“Here’s the run! Here’s the game!” came
from the crowd as Jack Daly walked coolly to the
plate. “Lewis will score!”</p>

<p>A safe hit or a long fly meant victory, if Locke
continued his fine work and shut out the home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
team in the last half of the inning. Lefty, swinging
two bats to make one seem lighter when he
should hit, felt his heart thudding like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>On all sides men were waving their arms wildly
and making a tremendous tumult. If only Daly
could do it! Locke followed Daly, and he
wondered vaguely whether he could make good if
the third baseman failed.</p>

<p>Russell’s first ball went wide of the plate. Another
one came across waist high, and Daly fell on
it with all his might. There was a twist on the
sphere, however, and, instead of a smashing line
drive, a short fly to right field resulted.</p>

<p>Burns called out that he would take it, and Russell
raced behind Fargo to back up a throw to the
plate. Burns made the catch easily, and was
ready to throw Lewis out if he attempted to score.</p>

<p>The Blue Stockings’ fielder was taking no
chances, however. He stuck to third, waiting for
something safer to take him home.</p>

<p>The witnesses who favored the Hornets applauded
the catch, while the opposition strained
their lungs rooting for Locke.</p>

<p>The latter felt a queer tightening of his throat
as he toed the line. Again the opportunity had
come for him to show what he could do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>Russell had never been cooler or less flurried.
He worked skillfully until two strikes and as many
balls had been called. The fear came to Lefty that
he was going to whiff, and he set his teeth, watching
the pitcher like a hawk.</p>

<p>Russell took his time. As the sphere left his
fingers, Locke suddenly remembered a certain fast
curve he had seen the Hornet man working up
down in Texas, but which he had not used thus far
in this game. The conviction flashed into his mind
that it was being used now, and in an instant he
had taken a single step forward, bringing his bat
around with a powerful swing as he did so.</p>

<p>The connection was perfect, and the ball went
curving out toward the left wing of the grandstand,
looking for a second or two like a home run.
It was too high for that, however, and fell in front
of the stand a couple of yards inside the foul
line.</p>

<p>The fielder got under it and smothered it effectually,
making a long, powerful throw to the plate,
toward which Lewis had sprinted the instant the
catch was made. The ball went wide, however,
and Lewis slid across the rubber in safety with
the leading run.</p>

<small>LEFTY’S TRIUMPH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Again the crowd cheered and yelled like
lunatics, shouting Locke’s name over and
over as he walked toward the bench. His
teammates surrounded him, patting him on the
back and uttering brief, friendly words of praise.
He was one of them now. He had won his spurs
and fairly earned the right to their esteem.</p>

<p>But the game was not over. Russell fanned the
next batter with swift precision, and the Blue
Stockings took the field. Their supporters in the
stands urged the southpaw, in frantic terms, to
“Hold ’em!”</p>

<p>The Hornets’ sympathizers were equally vehement
in their entreaties to the home team to “Get
in there and smash it out!” The uproar was
deafening. It subsided only when Ed Nolan
walked up and squared himself at the plate.
There were a few last shouts of encouragement,
and then silence, tense and absolute, fell upon the
vast inclosure.</p>

<p>Lefty knew that the Hornets’ fielder was a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
to fear. He could hit almost any kind of ball with
ease. In fact, the southpaw, in spite of his having
played so many practice games against the
fellow, had never yet fathomed his hitting weakness.
He wished that almost any other man in the
batting list could have been the one to face him
now, but there was no use pining for the impossible,
so he proceeded to send over a tempting
feeler.</p>

<p>But Nolan declined to be fooled. He disdained
the first two balls, and the crowd began to shout
for a free pass.</p>

<p>Then Lefty whipped over a good one, following
it with a whizzer with a perplexing jump just before
it reached the pan. But the batter was there
with the goods, and, though he did not strike the
horsehide quite squarely, he lashed it out between
second and short.</p>

<p>Lewis lunged for it, and his fingers almost
touched the sphere, but not quite. Nolan rounded
first to the accompaniment of much joyful
clamor.</p>

<p>And now came Fargo, the man who knew
Locke’s methods better than any other on the team.
The southpaw worked him with the utmost care,
pitching as he had never pitched before; and
then, just as he fancied he had the backstop in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
hole, Buck suddenly and unexpectedly bunted,
sending the ball rolling slowly toward first.</p>

<p>Lefty got the sphere, but secured it in bad
position to throw. Without attempting to
straighten up, he jerked it past Fargo, who was
making the final long strides for the sack.</p>

<p>Grant should have caught it, for the throw was
good. Perhaps he was too confident. Perhaps
there was no excuse at all, for even Big League
players make errors of that sort now and then.
At all events, he dropped the ball. The spectators
fairly made the stands shake with their raucous
joy.</p>

<p>“Hit it out!” they shrieked. “Smash it on the
nose! Here’s where we get two runs and the
game!”</p>

<p>Pollock did his best, but only succeeded in sending
up a high fly into short center which the fielder
secured with ease. Then Johnny Burns hurried
up, eager to help things along, and confident that
he could do it.</p>

<p>Lefty felt that the man was positively itching
to hit. He could read it in the fellow’s face and
manner, and he determined to play upon the batter’s
eagerness. A high drop across Burns’
shoulder deceived him, but did not shake his confidence.
It was followed by another high ball,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
which was, however, an inshoot, and again the
Hornet fielder missed.</p>

<p>“Hit it, Johnny!” pleaded the local fans.
“Don’t let him fool you. Smash it out.”</p>

<p>“Fan him!” shrieked the Blue Stockings’ supporters
wildly, their hopes beginning to rise again.
“Fan him, Lefty! You’ve got to do it.”</p>

<p>Lefty hesitated a second, his face cool and impenetrable,
the muscles of his jaw sharply defined.
He felt that the batter would expect him to try
a coaxer; for, with no balls called, most pitchers
would feel that they could afford to waste one or
two.</p>

<p>He glanced round, his foot on the slab. When
he turned back, he pitched without the slightest
preliminary swing, sending over a high, straight,
speedy ball. It had been his object to catch Burns
unprepared, and he succeeded. The batter struck
a second too late, and the ball spanked into Nelson’s
glove.</p>

<p>“Out!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>But the word was not heard because of the
deafening roar which rose from the delighted
visitors.</p>

<p>Lefty was scarcely conscious of the turmoil. It
sounded faint and far away, like the beating of
breakers on a rocky coast, and mingled insensibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
with the words <a href="#i_frontis">he was saying</a> over and over <a href="#i_frontis">to
himself:</a></p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">“One more! Only one more! I must get him—I’ve
got to!”</a></p>

<p>He dared not risk a glance at that upper box.
The moment was too tense. And yet in his mind
he pictured the girl leaning breathlessly over the
railing, her tiny gloved hands clasped rigidly together,
her face a little pale, her violet eyes wide
open and almost black with excitement. She must
not be disappointed—she should not!</p>

<p>How Sandy Rollins missed the first ball he
reached for was something he never understood.
When he struck, he felt absolutely certain that he
would meet it full upon the trademark. His
failure brought a ludicrous expression of surprise
to his face.</p>

<p>The Blue Stockings’ rooters yelled madly.
Most of them were on their feet now, staring down
into the diamond. The opposing fans, beginning
to lose hope, divided their efforts between hurling
caustic comments at the batter and trying to break
the pitcher up.</p>

<p>In this latter attempt they were unsuccessful.
Locke paid absolutely no attention to them. It
is doubtful whether he was conscious of their
presence. He was not faltering now. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
wasting no time, yet he did not hurry. He put
over an erratic curve that fooled Rollins even more
than had the first one. Indeed, the ball seemed
actually to dodge the bat as the Hornets’ baseman
slashed at it.</p>

<p>Another roar went up which drowned the umpire’s
voice. Nolan, quivering with eagerness,
held himself ready to run, working off third.
Lefty drove him back.</p>

<p>A hush settled upon the field. It almost seemed
as if each little human atom of the thousands
which overflowed the wide sweep of stand and
bleacher had ceased to breathe. Even the coachers
were silent for the instant—and Locke pitched.</p>

<p>Rollins’ judgment told him that the ball would
cut a corner when it broke. He was not mistaken.
It came over; but, instead of crossing the
outside corner, as he expected, it took such a sharp,
amazing shoot over the inside that the batter
missed cleanly.</p>

<p>“Out!” shouted the umpire, flinging up one
hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI<br>
<small>HOW IT ALL HAPPENED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Cheer after cheer went up from the throng
of visiting fans. Hats and canes and
newspapers were thrown into the air with
careless abandon. Men brought their fists down
on shoulders and heads of persons they had never
seen before; and these persons merely pushed out
the tops of crushed derbies, and grinned.</p>

<p>Down from the stands they poured like a cataract,
yelling Locke’s name. They caught and
surrounded him before he could flee to the shelter
of the clubhouse.</p>

<p>Jack Stillman was one of the first to reach the
field. Though he longed to hurry over to Lefty
and shake his friend’s hand, there was something
more important which must be done first. He
headed straight for Brennan, who, with gloomy
countenance, was about to leave the field.</p>

<p>“Wait a second, Jim,” the reporter called
swiftly. “I’ve got something to tell you. You
fired Lefty Locke because you thought he was a
quitter,” he went on when they came together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“You needn’t rub it in,” snapped the sorely
tried manager. “If that’s all you’ve got to
say—”</p>

<p>“It isn’t,” returned Stillman quickly. “Locke
said he never wrote that fake telegram which called
him away from Ashland the day of the game he
was to pitch. He told the truth. It was sent by
one of his own teammates, who hated him and
wanted to put him in bad.”</p>

<p>“What?” exploded the stocky manager. “I
don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>The reporter pulled a folded paper from his
pocket and handed it to Brennan. “There’s the
proof,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>The manager jerked it open and cast his eyes
hurriedly down the sheet. Wrath clouded his
face.</p>

<p>“Elgin!” he growled throwing back his head.
“Where is he? Just let me— Hey, you Elgin!
Come here!”</p>

<p>His voice and manner had drawn several curious
players near, among them Buck Fargo. The disgruntled
pitcher, hearing his name uttered in that
tone, came reluctantly over, expecting a call-down
for his work on the slab. What followed was
totally unexpected.</p>

<p>“You can pack!” Brennan snapped, eying the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
fellow with a look of scathing contempt. “I’m
going to send you down to the ‘Lobsters.’ They
want a pitcher, and they can have you—for keeps,
if I can’t sell you.” The Lobsters were a much
scoffed-at minor league club.</p>

<p>Elgin’s jaw dropped and his face flamed scarlet.
“You’re going to send me down to the—the Lobsters?”
he stammered.</p>

<p>“I am. I’ve found out the dirty trick you
played on Locke in Ashland, and I wouldn’t have
a scoundrel like you on my team if you was the
best pitcher in the country—which you ain’t, by a
long shot.”</p>

<p>For an instant the pitcher stood staring at him,
an indescribable expression on his face. He cast
a single swift glance at the players standing
around. Then, without a word, he turned and
walked hastily away through the gathering crowd.</p>

<p>“Good riddance!” growled Brennan.</p>

<p>He stood chewing meditatively on the stub of an
unlighted cigar. After a moment he shrugged his
shoulders and pushed his way through the crowd
to where Lefty and a few of the Blue Stockings
were hemmed in by the throng.</p>

<p>“You did a fine job, kid,” he said gruffly, thrusting
out a square, stubby hand. “Shake!”</p>

<p>Without hesitation Lefty gripped his fingers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
Brennan’s treatment had caused him some bitter
hours, but this was no time to harbor resentment.
The short manager turned to Kennedy, his mouth
twisted in a wry smile.</p>

<p>“You can kick me good and hard, Ken,” he said.
“I sure fell flat on this deal.” His eyes twinkled,
and the smile broadened to a grin. “I sort of
think this boy belongs to me. I had the first rights
to him, and I reckon I’ll pull him back now.”</p>

<p>“Not if I know it!” laughed Kennedy. “You
were thick enough to release him unconditionally.
He belongs to me now, and you bet he’s going to
stay.”</p>

<p>But old Jack could not foresee the approaching
wave of change that was to leave him stranded as
a baseball manager. Nor was Lefty Locke, in
spite of the splendid beginning he had made, to
find it all fair sailing in the Big League. With
Kennedy retired and Lefty missing, following his
suspension by the new manager, the Blue Stockings
were destined to have their troubles in the
fight for the pennant. How old Jack and the
young southpaw star returned to the field of battle
barely in time to save the day is dramatically
told in “Lefty o’ the Blue Stockings,” the third
volume of The Big League Series.</p>

<p>Brennan chuckled a little over Kennedy’s retort,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
and then turned to Lefty, his face suddenly
serious.</p>

<p>“I’ve found out about that fake telegram,” he
said, in a low tone. “Jack Stillman ferreted out
the truth, and the Hornets won’t have any further
use for Elgin.”</p>

<p>He walked away without waiting for a reply,
leaving Lefty almost bewildered at the events
which were coming so thick and fast. In the midst
of everything, however, he kept thinking of Janet
and wondering whether there was any possible
chance of her coming down upon the field.</p>

<p>The question was swiftly answered by the appearance
of Jack Stillman, elbowing his way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Some pitching for a starter in the Big League,
old man,” he laughed, his face glowing; “you
were pretty fair! I can’t keep you now, though;
there’s somebody over by the stand who wants a
word with you. See you in the clubhouse, later.”</p>

<p>Taking his friend by the arm, he piloted him
through the throng, now beginning to stream toward
the gates, to a point from which he could
see the girl he had been thinking about so much.
She stood near one of the lower boxes of the center
stand, a slim, graceful figure in a blue tailor-made
gown. At a little distance her friends were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
gathered, watching the animated scene interestedly.</p>

<p>Janet herself was talking earnestly to Buck
Fargo, but her eyes were quick to spy out Lefty
as he approached. The glad smile she gave him
was something to be treasured long in his memory.</p>

<p>“Lefty!” she exclaimed, in a low voice, which
vibrated with emotion. She took a quick step forward;
their hands met. “I can’t tell you how
glad and proud I am—and sorry.”</p>

<p>The man held her hands for an instant. His
face was puzzled.</p>

<p>“Sorry?” he repeated. “What have I done to
make you sorry?”</p>

<p>Her lovely eyes were fixed earnestly on his.
Fargo had slipped away.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she returned hastily. “What you
have done is splendid—wonderful! It’s what I
did that makes me sorry. Mr. Fargo has just told
me everything, and I hate myself when I think
how I—liked that dreadful Mr. Elgin—and tried
to make you friends, and—and—”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly and bit her lip. Lefty
looked around. Never before had he detested
a crowd with such intensity. His eyes flashed
back to hers, and something in their expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
brought a vivid rush of crimson flaming to her
face.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think about it,” he urged softly.
“You weren’t to blame, and, anyway, it’s all over
now. Everything’s turned out right. Please forget
it.”</p>

<p>His fingers tightened about hers. Her lids
drooped. They had forgotten the crowd pouring
out of the field. The clatter and tramp in the
swiftly thinning stands, the last few cheers from
the departing rooters, fell upon deaf ears. In that
single moment they were conscious of nothing else
in the whole wide world but just each other.</p>
